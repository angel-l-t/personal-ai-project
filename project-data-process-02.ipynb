They receive guidance from the stake presidency. They care for ward members with love, helping them become true followers of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 7:48).\\nThe bishop and his counselors are high priests. If they are not high priests when they are called, they should be ordained high priests before they are set apart to serve.\\nThe bishop has five principal responsibilities:\\n\\n\\nHe is the presiding high priest in the ward.\\n\\n\\nHe is president of the Aaronic Priesthood.\\n\\n\\nHe is a common judge.\\n\\n\\nHe coordinates God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward, including caring for those in need.\\n\\n\\nHe oversees records, finances, and the use of the meetinghouse.\\n\\n\\nBecause the bishop holds priesthood keys, he has the right to receive revelation for the ward (see Doctrine and Covenants 128:11). Therefore, some responsibilities are his alone. These are described in this chapter.\\nThe bishop’s foremost responsibility is to the rising generation in the ward (the children, youth, and young single adults). To enable him to concentrate on this responsibility, he delegates many assignments (see 4.2.5). He may delegate to his counselors, the clerk and assistant clerks, the executive secretary, quorum and organization leaders, and others.\\nIf the bishop is unable to perform his responsibilities, a counselor may act in his place temporarily, except as noted in this handbook. The bishop or his counselor consults with the stake president if he has questions about the counselor acting for the bishop.\\n\\n', '\\nPresiding High Priest\\n\\nThe bishop is the ward’s primary spiritual leader. He sets an example by serving “with holiness of heart” (Mosiah 18:12). He teaches, uplifts, and inspires (see Matthew 20:28). He follows the principles of leadership in Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–46.\\nA bishop is a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. He is true to his covenants. He is loyal to his wife and family. He sets an example of righteousness for his family, the ward, and the community. (See 1\\xa0Timothy 3:2–7.) His counselors are men of similar character.\\nThe bishop provides guidance and counsel to other leaders in the ward. He encourages them in their responsibilities.\\n\\n', '\\nWard Organizations and Priesthood Quorums\\n\\nThe bishop has responsibility for the ward Relief Society and Young Women organizations. He assigns his counselors responsibility for the Sunday School and Primary organizations and other ward programs. (See 9.3.1, 11.3.1, 12.3.1, and 13.2.1.)\\nThe bishop’s responsibilities for Aaronic Priesthood quorums are outlined in 7.1.2. His responsibilities for elders quorums are outlined in 8.3.1.\\nThe bishop also guides the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents in overseeing ministering. He meets with these two presidents together at least quarterly to address the needs of individuals and families (see 21.2).\\n\\n\\n', '\\nOrdinances and Blessings\\n\\nThe bishop directs the administration of the following ordinances and blessings in the ward:\\n\\n\\nThe sacrament\\n\\n\\nNaming and blessing of children\\n\\n\\nBaptism and confirmation of 8-year-old children of record (for those with intellectual disabilities, see 38.2.8.1; for converts, see 31.2.3.2)\\n\\n\\nConferral of the Aaronic Priesthood and ordination to the offices of deacon, teacher, and priest\\n\\n\\nFor information about ordinances and blessings, see chapter\\xa018.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nCouncils and Meetings\\n\\nThe bishop leads the ward council and the ward youth council (see 29.2.5 and 29.2.6). He uses these councils to help coordinate God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward. He delegates much of this work and follows up on assignments (see 4.2.5).\\nThe bishop invites leaders to counsel together about how to build spiritual strength and unity in the ward. He encourages all council members to seek inspiration and participate in discussions. (See Doctrine and Covenants 88:122; see also 4.4 in this handbook.)\\nThe bishopric plans sacrament meetings and other ward meetings listed in chapter\\xa029. The bishop presides at ward meetings unless a member of the stake presidency, an Area Seventy in his area, or a General Authority attends. The bishop’s counselors may conduct these meetings. They also preside if the bishop is absent.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nCallings and Releases\\n\\nThe bishop’s responsibilities for callings and releases are outlined in chapter\\xa030. He may assign his counselors to extend callings and releases as outlined in 30.8.\\n\\n  Imageman and woman shaking hands\\n\\n\\n', '\\nPresident of the Aaronic Priesthood\\n\\n“The bishopric is the presidency of [the Aaronic] priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:15; see also verse\\xa020). The bishop has the following responsibilities as the president of the Aaronic Priesthood in the ward. His counselors assist him.\\n\\n\\nSupport parents in teaching youth. Help youth serve faithfully, make and keep sacred covenants, and prepare to receive the ordinances of the temple. Help young men prepare to be ordained to priesthood offices and to serve full-time missions. If young women desire to serve full-time missions, help them prepare. The Children and Youth program can help in these efforts (see ChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\\n\\n\\nOversee Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes. The bishop is president of the priests quorum (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:87–88). His first counselor has responsibility for the teachers quorum. His second counselor has responsibility for the deacons quorum. For more information about Aaronic Priesthood quorum leadership, see 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5.\\n\\n\\nCounsel with the ward Young Women president. The bishop does not delegate this assignment to a counselor. He and his counselors also regularly participate in Young Women meetings, service, and activities. (See 11.3.1.)\\n\\n\\nMeet regularly with each youth. For guidelines about these meetings, see 31.3.1.\\n\\n\\nSupport families and Primary leaders and teachers in their efforts to help children make and keep covenants (see chapter\\xa012).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\nCommon Judge\\n\\nThe bishop is the common judge in the ward (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:71–74). He strives to follow the example of the Savior as a righteous judge (see 3\\xa0Nephi 27:27). He has the following responsibilities:\\n\\n\\nHelp youth and adults qualify for and be worthy of a temple recommend.\\n\\n\\nConduct interviews as outlined in 31.2. He may authorize his counselors to conduct certain interviews (see 31.2.2). For guidelines, see 31.1.\\n\\n\\nMeet with ward members who seek spiritual guidance, who have weighty personal problems, or who have committed serious sins, helping them draw on the healing power of Jesus Christ. The bishop may ask his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and others to meet with ward members about some matters. However, only the bishop meets with ward members about matters of worthiness, abuse, and approval to use fast-offering funds. For guidelines, see 31.1.\\n\\n\\nUnder the direction of the stake president, hold membership councils as needed. For guidelines, see chapter\\xa032.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\nCoordinating God’s Work of Salvation and Exaltation in the Ward\\n\\nThe bishop coordinates God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward (see chapter\\xa01). His counselors and other ward leaders assist him.\\nThe bishop helps members live the gospel.

He has sometimes allowed His holy ordinances to be administered outside of temples when there was no dedicated temple (see Genesis 28:12–22; Exodus\\xa024; Exodus 25:8–9; Ether\\xa03). But whenever the Lord has established His Church, He has commanded His people to build a house “unto [His] name.” There He reveals His ordinances and the glories of His kingdom and teaches the way of salvation. (See 2\\xa0Chronicles 3–5; 2\\xa0Nephi 5:16; Doctrine and Covenants 97:10–16; 124:29–39.)\\nThe temple is the house of the Lord. It points us to our Savior, Jesus Christ. In temples, we participate in sacred ordinances and make covenants with Heavenly Father that bind us to Him and to our Savior. These covenants and ordinances prepare us to return to Heavenly Father’s presence and to be sealed together as families for eternity.\\nIn the temple, great blessings are also made available to God’s faithful children in this life. In temple covenants and ordinances, “the power of godliness is manifest” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:20). The temple is a holy place where members can worship, learn, and receive guidance and comfort (see Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–16). Those who attend the temple can have access to God’s power to help accomplish His work (see Doctrine and Covenants 109:22–23; see also 3.5 in this handbook).\\nTemple covenants and ordinances are sacred. The symbols associated with temple covenants should not be discussed outside the temple. Nor should we discuss the holy information we covenant in the temple not to reveal. However, we may discuss the basic purposes and doctrine of temple covenants and ordinances and the spiritual feelings we have in the temple.\\nWard and stake leaders discuss the information in this chapter with members who are preparing to receive the endowment or sealing ordinances.\\n']\n",

The ordinances of salvation and exaltation are:\\n\\n\\nBaptism.\\n\\n\\nConfirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n\\nConferral of the Melchizedek Priesthood and ordination to an office (for men).\\n\\n\\nThe temple endowment (including the initiatory).\\n\\n\\nTemple sealing.\\n\\n\\nHeavenly Father knew that many of His children would not receive these ordinances during their mortal lives. He provided another way for them to receive ordinances and make covenants with Him. In temples, ordinances can be performed by proxy. This means that a living person receives ordinances on behalf of someone who is deceased. In the spirit world, deceased persons can choose to accept or reject ordinances that have been performed for them (see Doctrine and Covenants 138:19, 32–34, 58–59).\\nThe ordinances of salvation and exaltation are not needed or performed for those who were not accountable in this life (see 18.1, 28.3.2, and 28.3.3).\\nChurch members are encouraged to identify deceased relatives who have not received the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. Members then perform the ordinances on behalf of those relatives. (See Malachi 4:5–6; 1\\xa0Corinthians 15:29; Doctrine and Covenants 2:1–3; 128:15–18; see also 25.1 in this handbook.)\\nIf members have not prepared family names for temple work (see 28.1.1), the names of deceased persons who need ordinances will be provided at the temple.\\nMembers are encouraged to attend the temple as often as their circumstances allow, whether they are performing proxy ordinances for their own relatives or for persons whose names are provided at the temple.\\nChurch members are blessed when they perform temple ordinances for the deceased. While performing proxy ordinances, they are able to reflect on their own temple covenants and their commitment to keep those covenants.\\nStake presidents and bishops help members prepare to have positive experiences performing temple ordinances. They do this by teaching the doctrinal basis of temple work and ensuring that members understand the guidelines for this work. See chapter\\xa025 for more information.\\n']\n",

Likewise, the Lord calls men and women to serve in the Church today through inspired invitations from His servants. These opportunities to serve are known as callings.\\nCallings give members opportunities to feel the joy of serving God by serving His children (see Mosiah 2:17). Callings also help members increase their faith and draw closer to the Lord.\\nIt is not appropriate to aspire to specific callings in the Church (see Mark 10:42–45; Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–37). Nor do Church members “advance” from one calling to another. After serving in one calling, they should not expect to receive a calling of greater responsibility or prominence. Serving faithfully in a calling is more important than what the calling is. The Lord honors the dedication of all who serve in His Church.\\nThis chapter describes how members are called to serve in the Church and how they are released from their callings.

One important way you can do this is through interviews and other one-on-one meetings. Some of your most meaningful service will happen one on one. In these settings, you can give Christlike love, lifting up “the hands which hang down” and strengthening “the feeble knees” (Doctrine and Covenants 81:5).\\nIn this chapter, the term interview refers to a meeting between a leader and an individual to determine whether the person should participate in an ordinance or receive a calling (see 31.2). In general, these interviews are conducted by a member of the bishopric or stake presidency. The term interview also refers to ministering interviews conducted by a member of the Relief Society or elders quorum presidency (see 21.3).\\nIn addition to these interviews, there are many other reasons a Church leader may meet with individual members (see 31.3). For example, the bishopric has regularly scheduled meetings with each youth in the ward (see 31.3.1).

Members may receive a temple recommend when they faithfully keep the required commandments and live the gospel of Jesus Christ. (See chapter\\xa026.)\\n\\n\\n', '\\nUnmarried Member Participation and Blessings\\n\\nAll members, even if they have never married or are without family in the Church, should strive for the ideal of living in an eternal family. This means preparing to be sealed as a worthy husband or wife and to become a loving father or mother. For some, these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all.\\nFaithful members whose circumstances do not allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life will receive all promised blessings in the eternities, provided they keep the covenants they have made with God (see Mosiah 2:41).\\n\\n\\n', '\\nUnwed Parents under Age\\xa018\\n\\nAn unwed young man under age\\xa018 who is going to become a father may participate in his Aaronic Priesthood quorum or in the elders quorum. This decision is left to the prayerful discretion of the young man, his parents, and the bishop.\\nAn unwed young woman under age\\xa018 who is going to become a mother may participate in Young Women or in Relief Society. This decision is left to the prayerful discretion of the young woman, her parents, and the bishop.\\nIn making this decision, youth, parents, and leaders consider the following:\\n\\n\\nIf the youth participates in youth classes and activities, the child should not accompany him or her.\\n\\n\\nOlder youth who choose to raise the child may benefit from being welcomed into the elders quorum as prospective elders or into Relief Society.\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

The blessings of an eternal family are realized as members keep those covenants and repent when they fall short. Church leaders help members prepare to receive these ordinances and honor their covenants. Each person may fulfill a number of roles in an eternal family. All family roles are sacred and important. These roles may include mother and father, daughter and son, sister and brother, aunt and uncle, and grandmother and grandfather. Fulfilling these roles in love helps God’s children progress toward eternal life. An additional aspect of establishing eternal families is performing ordinances in the temple that allow members to be sealed to their deceased ancestors. With an understanding of God’s plan, members seek the blessings of an eternal family.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.2 Husband and Wife Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 49:15). A husband and wife are intended to progress together toward eternal life (see 1 Corinthians 11:11). One of the requirements for obtaining eternal life is for a man and a woman to enter the covenant of celestial marriage (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4). A couple makes this covenant when they receive the marriage sealing ordinance in the temple. This covenant is the foundation of an eternal family. When faithfully kept, it allows their marriage to endure forever. Ultimately, they can become like God (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20). God has commanded husbands and wives to cleave to each other (see Genesis 2:24; Doctrine and Covenants 42:22). In this context, the word cleave means to be completely devoted and faithful to someone. Married couples cleave together by loving and serving each other. Cleaving also includes total fidelity between husband and wife. Physical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Tenderness and respect—not selfishness—should guide their intimate relationship. God has commanded that sexual intimacy is to be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. Remaining sexually pure before marriage and faithful within marriage helps individuals be truly happy and avoid spiritual, emotional, and physical harm. Parents and Church leaders are encouraged to do all they can to reinforce this teaching. (See 38.6.5.) A couple seeks to be unified in establishing their family (see Genesis 2:24). Being united in marriage requires a full partnership, sharing responsibilities. A husband and wife are equal in God’s eyes. One should not dominate the other. Their decisions should be made in unity and love, with full participation of both. Adam and Eve set an example for husbands and wives. They worked, prayed, and worshipped together (see Moses 5:1, 4). They taught their children the gospel and mourned together over their trials (see Moses 5:12, 27). They were united with each other and with God.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.3 Parents and Children God’s first commandment to Adam and Eve as husband and wife was to have children (see Genesis 1:28). Latter-day prophets have taught that “God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”; see also Doctrine and Covenants 49:16–17). It is a sacred privilege and responsibility for a husband and wife to care for the children they are able to bear or adopt. Adoptive parents have the same blessings and responsibilities as biological parents. A loving husband and wife together provide the best setting for rearing and nurturing children. Individual circumstances may prevent parents from rearing their children together. However, the Lord will bless them as they seek His help and strive to keep their covenants with Him. Parents have the vital responsibility to help their children prepare to receive the blessings of eternal life. They teach their children to love and serve God and others (see Matthew 22:36–40). They teach them to pray to Heavenly Father and study the word of God (see Alma 37:36–37, 44–46). They help their children understand the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25). They also help them prepare to make covenants as they receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. “Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). When there is not a husband or father in the home, the mother presides over the family. Presiding in the family is the responsibility to help lead family members back to dwell in God’s presence. This is done by serving and teaching with gentleness, meekness, and pure love, following the example of Jesus Christ (see Matthew 20:26–28). Presiding in the family includes leading family members in regular prayer, gospel study, and other aspects of worship. Parents work in unity to fulfill these responsibilities. “Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). To nurture means to nourish, teach, and support, following the example of the Savior (see 3 Nephi 10:4). In unity with her husband, a mother helps her family learn gospel truths and develop faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Together they foster an environment of love in the family. “In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). They prayerfully counsel together and with the Lord.\n",

The Sabbath is a day of gospel learning and teaching at church and at home.

Singing or playing hymns and Primary songs (see chapter 19). Supporting family members in Children and Youth development. A family council to set goals, resolve problems, and coordinate schedules. Recreational activities. Single members and others can gather in groups outside the normal Sabbath worship services to participate in home evening and strengthen one another through gospel study. Come, Follow Me may be a resource for those who desire to study together. To provide time for families to be together, leaders should keep Monday evenings free from Church meetings and activities.

Through this authority, Church leaders direct and administer all the spiritual work of the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:18). The President of the Church is the presiding high priest over the Melchizedek Priesthood (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:65–67).

The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by those who hold priesthood keys (see Doctrine and Covenants 65:2). 3.4.1.1 Those Who Hold Priesthood Keys Jesus Christ holds all the keys of the priesthood. Under His direction, priesthood keys are given to men to use in specific callings to help accomplish God’s work, as explained below. The Lord has conferred on each of His Apostles all the keys that pertain to the kingdom of God on earth. The senior living Apostle, the President of the Church, is the only person on earth authorized to exercise all of those priesthood keys (see Doctrine and Covenants 81:1–2; 107:64–67, 91–92; 132:7). Under the direction of the President of the Church, the following priesthood leaders are given keys so they can preside in their areas of responsibility: Stake and district presidents. Bishops and branch presidents. Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidents. Temple presidents. Mission presidents and missionary training center presidents. Church historic site presidents. These leaders receive priesthood keys when they are set apart to their callings. Priesthood keys are not given to others, including counselors to local priesthood leaders or presidents of Church organizations. These leaders are given delegated authority when they are set apart and when they receive assignments under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. Presidents of Church organizations preside under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys (see 4.2.4). Imageward council meeting 3.4.1.2 Order to God’s Work Priesthood keys ensure that God’s work of salvation and exaltation is accomplished in an orderly manner (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:11; 132:8). Those who hold priesthood keys direct the Lord’s work within their areas of responsibility. This presiding authority is valid only for the specific responsibilities of the leader’s calling. When priesthood leaders are released from their callings, they no longer hold these keys. All who serve in the Church are set apart or assigned under the direction of one who holds priesthood keys.\n",

      "3.4.2 Priesthood Conferral and Ordination Under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys, the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood are conferred on worthy male Church members (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:14–17). After the appropriate priesthood is conferred, the person is ordained to an office in that priesthood, such as deacon or elder. A priesthood holder exercises the priesthood according to the rights and duties of that office (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:99). Each man in the Church of Jesus Christ should strive to be worthy to receive and use the Melchizedek Priesthood to serve others. When a man receives this priesthood, he makes a covenant to faithfully fulfill his priesthood responsibilities. He also receives from God an oath, or promise, of eternal blessings (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–44; see also Guide to the Scriptures, “Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood”).

Individual circumstances may prevent parents from rearing their children together. However, the Lord will bless them as they seek His help and strive to keep their covenants with Him.\\nParents have the vital responsibility to help their children prepare to receive the blessings of eternal life. They teach their children to love and serve God and others (see Matthew 22:36–40). They teach them to pray to Heavenly Father and study the word of God (see Alma 37:36–37, 44–46). They help their children understand the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25). They also help them prepare to make covenants as they receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation.\\n“Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). When there is not a husband or father in the home, the mother presides over the family.\\nPresiding in the family is the responsibility to help lead family members back to dwell in God’s presence. This is done by serving and teaching with gentleness, meekness, and pure love, following the example of Jesus Christ (see Matthew 20:26–28). Presiding in the family includes leading family members in regular prayer, gospel study, and other aspects of worship. Parents work in unity to fulfill these responsibilities.\\n“Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). To nurture means to nourish, teach, and support, following the example of the Savior (see 3\\xa0Nephi 10:4). In unity with her husband, a mother helps her family learn gospel truths and develop faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Together they foster an environment of love in the family.\\n“In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). They prayerfully counsel together and with the Lord.\\n\\n  Imagedad teaching family\\n']}\n",

In their homes, individuals and families engage in helping God accomplish His work of salvation and exaltation.\\nTo support members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation at home, Church leaders encourage them to establish a home where the Spirit is present. They also encourage members to honor the Sabbath day, study and learn the gospel at home, and hold weekly home evening. Leaders give special emphasis to supporting individuals who may lack assistance or encouragement from family members.\\n\\n', '\\nA Home Where the Spirit Is Present\\n\\nChurch members are encouraged to make their homes a place of spiritual strength and joy. They can invite the Spirit of the Lord into their homes through simple efforts.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nSabbath Observance\\n\\nGod has commanded His children to “remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8). Church members gather on the Sabbath to partake of the sacrament in remembrance of Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see Doctrine and Covenants 59:12). The Sabbath is a day of gospel learning and teaching at church and at home. Members can be strengthened on the Sabbath as they engage in activities such as:\\n\\n\\nPersonal worship through prayer and fasting.\\n\\n\\nGospel study and learning.\\n\\n\\nMinistering and service to others.\\n\\n\\nFamily history.\\n\\n\\nJoyful family time.\\n\\n\\nOther appropriate gatherings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\nGospel Study and Learning at Home\\n\\nGospel teaching and learning are home-centered and Church-supported. Church leaders encourage all members to study the gospel at home on the Sabbath day and throughout the week. Gospel study at home strengthens individuals and families. It deepens conversion to Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\\nA study of the scriptures as outlined in Come, Follow Me is the suggested course of gospel study at home.\\nIndividuals and families seek inspiration as they choose to study what will best meet their needs. In addition to the scripture passages suggested in Come, Follow Me, they might prayerfully consider studying:\\n\\n\\nThe Book of Mormon and other scriptures.\\n\\n\\nGeneral conference messages.\\n\\n\\nChurch magazines and other edifying content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\nHome Evening and Other Activities\\n\\nLatter-day prophets have counseled Church members to hold a weekly home evening. This is a sacred time for individuals and families to learn the gospel, strengthen testimonies, build unity, and enjoy one another.\\nHome evening is flexible according to members’ circumstances. It may be held on the Sabbath or other days and times. It may include:\\n\\n\\nGospel study and instruction (the Come, Follow Me materials may be used as desired).\\n\\n\\nServing others.\\n\\n\\nSinging or playing hymns and Primary songs (see chapter\\xa019).\\n\\n\\nSupporting family members in Children and Youth development.\\n\\n\\nA family council to set goals, resolve problems, and coordinate schedules.\\n\\n\\nRecreational activities.\\n\\n\\nSingle members and others can gather in groups outside the normal Sabbath worship services to participate in home evening and strengthen one another through gospel study. Come, Follow Me may be a resource for those who desire to study together.\\nTo provide time for families to be together, leaders should keep Monday evenings free from Church meetings and activities.\\nLeaders encourage members to be consistent in holding home evening and spending time together as families (see Doctrine and Covenants 64:33). This could include sharing meals, working and serving together, and recreational activities.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nSupporting Individuals\\n\\nChurch leaders assist members who need additional support. Leaders help these members and their families have opportunities for fellowship, wholesome social experiences, and spiritual growth. Leaders encourage and assist them in their efforts to learn and live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Leaders also give them opportunities to serve in the Church.\\n\\n  Imagecouple laughing\\n']}\n",

The following principles apply in the relationship between the home and the Church.\\n\\n\\nLeaders and teachers honor the role of parents and assist them. Leaders and teachers establish and maintain effective communication with parents.\\n\\n\\nSome Church meetings are essential in each ward or branch. These include sacrament meeting and the classes and quorum meetings held on the Sabbath. Many other meetings, activities, and programs are not essential. Leaders organize them as needed to help meet the needs of individuals and families. Leaders take into account local circumstances and resources.\\n\\n\\nIndividuals and families consider their circumstances when making decisions about participating in Church programs that are not essential.\\n\\n\\nThe Lord will bless members as they serve and sacrifice in His Church. However, the amount of time given to Church service should not detract from members’ ability to fulfill their responsibilities at home, at work, and elsewhere. Leaders and members should not be overwhelmed with too many Church responsibilities.
