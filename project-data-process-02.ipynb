We are part of their family. We lived with them before we were born on earth. As part of His plan, Heavenly Father has established families on earth. He intends for families to bring us happiness. Families provide opportunities to learn, grow, serve, repent, and forgive. They can help us prepare for eternal life. In this life, many people have limited opportunities for loving family relationships. No family is free from challenges, pain, and sorrow. Individuals and families exercise faith in the Lord and strive to live according to the truths He has revealed concerning the family. The Savior has promised that He will help bear the burdens of all who come unto Him (see Matthew 11:28–30). Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness ensures that all His children will have the opportunity to accept His gospel and receive His greatest blessings (see Doctrine and Covenants 137:7–10). All who make and keep covenants with God can experience joy and “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:23; see also Mosiah 2:41). God’s promise of eternal life includes eternal marriage, children, and all other blessings of an eternal family.

      "{27: 'Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 49:15). A husband and wife are intended to progress together toward eternal life (see 1\\xa0Corinthians 11:11). One of the requirements for obtaining eternal life is for a man and a woman to enter the covenant of celestial marriage (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4). A couple makes this covenant when they receive the marriage sealing ordinance in the temple. This covenant is the foundation of an eternal family. When faithfully kept, it allows their marriage to endure forever. Ultimately, they can become like God (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20). God has commanded husbands and wives to cleave to each other (see Genesis 2:24; Doctrine and Covenants 42:22). In this context, the word cleave means to be completely devoted and faithful to someone. Married couples cleave together by loving and serving each other. Cleaving also includes total fidelity between husband and wife. Physical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Tenderness and respect—not selfishness—should guide their intimate relationship. God has commanded that sexual intimacy is to be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. Remaining sexually pure before marriage and faithful within marriage helps individuals be truly happy and avoid spiritual, emotional, and physical harm. Parents and Church leaders are encouraged to do all they can to reinforce this teaching. (See 38.6.5.) A couple seeks to be unified in establishing their family (see Genesis 2:24). Being united in marriage requires a full partnership, sharing responsibilities. A husband and wife are equal in God’s eyes. One should not dominate the other. Their decisions should be made in unity and love, with full participation of both. Adam and Eve set an example for husbands and wives. They worked, prayed, and worshipped together (see Moses 5:1,\\xa04). They taught their children the gospel and mourned together over their trials (see Moses 5:12,\\xa027). They were united with each other and with God.', 'title': 'Husband and Wife', 'chapter': 'Supporting Individuals and Families in God’s Work of Salvation and Exaltation', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/2-supporting-individuals-and-families?lang=eng', 'section': '2.1'}\n",
      "{28: 'God’s first commandment to Adam and Eve as husband and wife was to have children (see Genesis 1:28). Latter-day prophets have taught that “God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”; see also Doctrine and Covenants 49:16–17). It is a sacred privilege and responsibility for a husband and wife to care for the children they are able to bear or adopt. Adoptive parents have the same blessings and responsibilities as biological parents. A loving husband and wife together provide the best setting for rearing and nurturing children. Individual circumstances may prevent parents from rearing their children together. However, the Lord will bless them as they seek His help and strive to keep their covenants with Him. Parents have the vital responsibility to help their children prepare to receive the blessings of eternal life. They teach their children to love and serve God and others (see Matthew 22:36–40). They teach them to pray to Heavenly Father and study the word of God (see Alma 37:36–37, 44–46). They help their children understand the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25). They also help them prepare to make covenants as they receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. “Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). When there is not a husband or father in the home, the mother presides over the family. Presiding in the family is the responsibility to help lead family members back to dwell in God’s presence. This is done by serving and teaching with gentleness, meekness, and pure love, following the example of Jesus Christ (see Matthew 20:26–28). Presiding in the family includes leading family members in regular prayer, gospel study, and other aspects of worship. Parents work in unity to fulfill these responsibilities. “Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). To nurture means to nourish, teach, and support, following the example of the Savior (see 3\\xa0Nephi 10:4). In unity with her husband, a mother helps her family learn gospel truths and develop faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Together they foster an environment of love in the family. “In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”).

Each man in the Church of Jesus Christ should strive to be worthy to receive and use the Melchizedek Priesthood to serve others. When a man receives this priesthood, he makes a covenant to faithfully fulfill his priesthood responsibilities. He also receives from God an oath, or promise, of eternal blessings (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–44; see also Guide to the Scriptures, “Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood”).

Effective teaching inspires people to strengthen their relationship with God and live the gospel, progressing toward eternal life.

Make the study of God’s word a high priority in your life. Gospel learning is a lifelong process. Teach from the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets (see Doctrine and Covenants 52:9). Remember that “the preaching of the word [has] more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than … anything else” (Alma 31:5). Seek the influence of the Spirit as you prepare and teach. The Holy Ghost carries the truth unto the hearts and minds of those you teach (see 2\\xa0Nephi 33:1).

Those who hold priesthood keys preside in their areas of responsibility, such as a quorum or ward. Other organizations in the Church, including the Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, and Sunday School, are also led by a presiding officer. These leaders are called, set apart, and given delegated authority by one who holds priesthood keys or someone he has authorized (see 3.4.3). Each presiding officer serves under the direction of a person who holds priesthood keys (see 3.4.1). This structure provides order and clear lines of responsibility and accountability in doing the Lord’s work. A presiding officer may delegate to another person a temporary assignment to preside. For example, if a Relief Society president will be absent from a Relief Society Sunday meeting, she would assign her first counselor to preside in the meeting. A leader who presides in a Church organization, meeting, or activity ensures that the Lord’s purposes are accomplished. In doing this, the leader follows gospel principles, Church policies, and the direction of the Holy Ghost. Those who preside follow the example of Jesus Christ in serving with gentleness, meekness, and pure love (see John 13:13–15). A calling or assignment to preside does not make the person who receives it more important or valued than others (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:109–10). If you have been called or assigned to preside, follow the Savior’s teaching that “whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant” (Matthew 20:27; see verses 26–28).

Strive to engage all members in doing God’s work. Delegating will also make your service more effective. If you try to do too much, you will “surely wear away” (Exodus 18:18). Seek the Spirit’s guidance about what to delegate so you can focus on your highest priorities. Delegating is more than giving an assignment. It also includes teaching and trusting another person to fulfill the assignment. It usually includes the following elements:   Meet with the person to invite him or her to serve the Lord in an assignment. Help the person understand the assignment and its purposes.   Counsel together about the assignment, who else could be involved, and when it should be finished. Ensure that the person understands and willingly accepts the assignment.

This principle applies to Church councils. During a council meeting, the leader (or someone the leader assigns) explains the matter being considered. The leader then encourages discussion among all council members, asking questions and seeking ideas. The leader encourages members to speak openly and honestly. The diverse backgrounds, ages, experiences, and viewpoints of council members enrich the council. Members share suggestions and listen to each other respectfully. As they seek to know the Lord’s will, a spirit of inspiration and unity can prevail. In a council that includes women and men, the leader seeks insights and ideas from both. Women and men often have different perspectives that provide needed balance. Men and women reach better decisions and have greater success in the Lord’s service as they value each other’s contributions and work together. A leader guides the council’s discussions. However, he or she should listen more than talk. When a council leader shares his or her perspective too early, it can inhibit the contributions of others. When necessary, the council leader gently redirects or refocuses the discussion. After the discussion, the leader may either decide on a course of action or postpone a decision while seeking additional information and guidance. The decision should be informed by the discussion and confirmed by the Spirit. The council process helps bring about inspired decisions that go beyond a leader’s own best judgment. The leader may also refer the matter to a different council. Sometimes council members may have unsettled feelings about an important decision. When this happens, the leader may wait for another meeting to consider the matter further and seek spiritual confirmation and unity.

      "{77: 'President of the Church. Since ancient days, the Lord has directed His people through prophets (see Amos 3:7; Ephesians 4:11–13). The President of the Church is a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is also the senior Apostle. Under the Lord’s direction, he presides over the Church and is the only person on earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys (see Matthew 16:16–19; see also 3.4.1.1 in this handbook). He has authority to receive revelation and declare the will of God for the whole Church. (See Doctrine and Covenants 43:2–3; 107:91–92; 128:11.) First Presidency. Through the President of the Church, the Lord calls counselors to assist in the work. The President and his counselors are “three Presiding High Priests … [who] form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:22). This quorum is called the First Presidency. Members of the First Presidency are Apostles and as such are “special witnesses” of the name of Jesus Christ (Doctrine and Covenants 107:23). The First Presidency presides over and directs all the affairs of the Church. Peter, James, and John fulfilled this role in the ancient Church. They were with the Savior on several sacred occasions and received the keys of the kingdom. (See Matthew 16:18–19; 17:1–5; Mark 14:32–42; Doctrine and Covenants 27:12–13; 81:1–2.) When the President of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved. The counselors return to their positions of seniority within the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Under the direction of the senior Apostle, the Quorum of the Twelve leads the Church. As a quorum, they consider when the First Presidency should be reorganized. After unanimous decision, the senior Apostle is ordained as the new President of the Church and calls his counselors. Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Anciently, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles to help lead His Church (see Luke 6:12–13; Ephesians 4:11–13; 1\\xa0Nephi 13:40). In our day, the Lord calls men through the President of the Church to be ordained as Apostles and to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:26–28). This quorum acts under the direction of the First Presidency to build up and regulate the Church in all nations (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:33). Members of the Twelve proclaim the gospel in all the world (see Matthew 28:19–20; Doctrine and Covenants 107:35). Each Apostle holds all the keys of the kingdom and exercises those keys under the direction of the President of the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 112:30–32). The Twelve Apostles are “special witnesses” of the name of Jesus Christ (Doctrine and Covenants 107:23; see also 27:12). They witness to all the world of His divinity and the reality of His Resurrection (see Acts 1:8,\\xa022; 4:33; Doctrine and Covenants 76:22–24). Apostles serve full-time in the Church for the remainder of their lives (see Matthew 4:18–22). The Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. All members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. Together they form the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Under the direction of the Lord and by unanimous voice, this council has authority to declare and interpret doctrine and establish policy for the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 1:38; 107:27–31).

Men and women who have not yet married or who are divorced or widowed make up a significant portion of Church membership. It is important for all to find hope through the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Ether 12:4). The following eternal truths can help develop such hope:   Scriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that everyone who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation.   The precise time and manner in which the blessings of exaltation are bestowed have not all been revealed. But they are nonetheless assured (see Mosiah 2:41).   Waiting upon the Lord implies continued obedience and spiritual progress toward Him (see Isaiah 64:4).   God offers eternal life to all of His children. All who qualify for the Savior’s gracious gift of forgiveness and live His commandments will receive eternal life. (See Mosiah 26:30; Moroni 6:8.)   Confidence in these assurances is rooted in faith in Jesus Christ. By His grace, all things pertaining to mortality are set right (see Alma 7:11–13).

Leaders may assign the youth to help minister to some or all of the individuals and families assigned to the companionship. Youth do not have ministering brothers or sisters assigned to them. They receive ministering care from their family’s ministering brothers. Their class or quorum presidency and adult leaders also minister to them. If their parents are not members of the Church but are open to receiving ministering, the elders quorum presidency may assign ministering brothers to the family. Similarly, the Relief Society presidency may assign ministering sisters to the mother. The Church’s guideline that two responsible adults be present with youth does not apply to ministering companions. However, leaders use wisdom and seek inspiration when assigning youth as companions to adults. They also seek guidance from the bishop. When a youth is assigned to a companion who is not his or her parent, leaders confirm that the parents do not object to the assignment. Adult companions should avoid situations that might be misunderstood. They use care in one-on-one situations. They help youth have a safe and rewarding experience with ministering.

Monthly contribution commitment. Young teaching missionaries and their families contribute a specific amount each month to help cover missionary program costs. The amount is set in one of two ways:   Missionaries from some countries participate in the equalized contribution program. This means the same amount is contributed for each missionary regardless of where he or she serves. The amount is identified at Church headquarters. Leaders may contact the Missionary Department (see 24.9.3) or the area office for a list of countries in this program and the equalized amount.   In other countries, the bishop, stake president, missionary, and family counsel together about the monthly contribution amount. The bishop and stake president consider guidance from the Area Presidency. They encourage appropriate financial sacrifice and self-reliance based on the circumstances of the missionary and his or her family. They agree on a contribution amount and record it in the missionary recommendation. The missionary and his or her family commit to follow through. Others may also contribute to this amount only if they live in the missionary’s home country (see “Ward Missionary Fund” later in this section).   Contributions are made to the ward missionary fund. Bishops verify that the funds are contributed each month. Funds beyond the monthly amount should not be contributed in advance. Funds contributed in advance cannot be refunded if a missionary returns home early. Expenses in the field. Each month, young missionaries receive adequate funds from the mission to provide for healthy food, transportation, and other living expenses. These funds are sacred. Missionaries use them only for mission-related purposes. They should not be used for personal expenses, saved, or sent to family members or others. Missionaries return to the mission any funds they do not need. Missionaries use personal funds to cover other expenses. These personal expenses should be minimal. (See Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ, 4.8.)   Ward Missionary Fund  The ward missionary fund is used only for donations relating to ward members who are serving missions away from home. These funds are not used for service missionaries or for missionary activities in the ward or stake. Funds are not sent directly to missionaries. Each month, the bishop sees that the committed funds are available in the ward missionary fund. The Church withdraws the contribution amount each month and uses it for missionary efforts worldwide. See 34.3.3. Contributions are consecrated to the Lord to accomplish His work. They cannot be refunded. Members who desire to help meet the monthly commitment of missionaries who are not in their home ward may do so. If the missionary’s ward is in the member’s country of residence, the member may donate to the missionary fund of the missionary’s home ward. If the missionary’s ward is not in the member’s country of residence, the member should donate to the General Missionary Fund. However, these donations cannot be designated to cover the contribution commitments of specific missionaries.

Sometimes a service missionary needs to end his or her mission early for health, worthiness, or other reasons. In these situations, the stake president notifies the mission president, the service mission leaders, and the area service mission specialists. The stake president then contacts the assigned in-field representative in the Missionary Department to have each early release reviewed and approved by an assigned General Authority. Service missions for young missionaries do not exceed 24\\xa0months for men. These missions do not exceed 18\\xa0months for women. Senior service missionaries may extend their service to a date agreed on by the stake president, operations manager, and missionary.

When members of a temple presidency identify a potential temple worker, they submit the person’s name to the bishop using the Recommend Temple Worker tool. When a bishop identifies a potential temple worker or receives a recommendation from a temple president, he counsels with the member about the opportunity to serve. He reviews the requirements for temple ordinance workers (see 25.5.2) or temple volunteers (see 25.5.3). If both the bishop and the member feel the opportunity would be appropriate, the bishop completes and submits the recommendation using the Recommend Temple Worker tool. The member should understand that a submitted recommendation does not ensure that he or she will be called or assigned as a temple worker. The recommendation is next reviewed by the stake president for members living in a stake. For members living in a district, the mission president reviews it.

He has sometimes allowed His holy ordinances to be administered outside of temples when there was no dedicated temple (see Genesis 28:12–22; Exodus\\xa024; Exodus 25:8–9; Ether\\xa03). But whenever the Lord has established His Church, He has commanded His people to build a house “unto [His] name.” There He reveals His ordinances and the glories of His kingdom and teaches the way of salvation. (See 2\\xa0Chronicles 3–5; 2\\xa0Nephi 5:16; Doctrine and Covenants 97:10–16; 124:29–39.) The temple is the house of the Lord. It points us to our Savior, Jesus Christ. In temples, we participate in sacred ordinances and make covenants with Heavenly Father that bind us to Him and to our Savior. These covenants and ordinances prepare us to return to Heavenly Father’s presence and to be sealed together as families for eternity. In the temple, great blessings are also made available to God’s faithful children in this life. In temple covenants and ordinances, “the power of godliness is manifest” (Doctrine and Covenants 84:20). The temple is a holy place where members can worship, learn, and receive guidance and comfort (see Doctrine and Covenants 109:13–16). Those who attend the temple can have access to God’s power to help accomplish His work (see Doctrine and Covenants 109:22–23; see also 3.5 in this handbook). Temple covenants and ordinances are sacred. The symbols associated with temple covenants should not be discussed outside the temple. Nor should we discuss the holy information we promise in the temple not to reveal.

Power to do all that Heavenly Father wants His children to do.   Divine direction when serving the Lord, their families, and others.   Increased hope, comfort, and peace.   All the promised blessings of the endowment are in force both in this life and for eternity. The fulfillment of these blessings depends on faithfulness to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The endowment is received in two parts. In the first part, a person receives preliminary ordinances called the initiatory. The initiatory comprises three ordinances: washing, anointing, and clothing (see Exodus 29:4–9). It includes special blessings related to the person’s divine heritage and potential. During the initiatory, the member covenants to wear the temple garment. The garment represents his or her personal relationship with God and the commitment to obey covenants made in the temple. When members are faithful to their covenants and wear the garment properly throughout their lives, it also serves as a protection. For information about wearing and caring for the garment, see 38.5.5. In the second part of the endowment, the plan of salvation is taught, including the Creation, the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Apostasy, and the Restoration. Members also receive instruction on how to return to the Lord’s presence. In the endowment, members are invited to make sacred covenants as follows:   Live the law of obedience and strive to keep Heavenly Father’s commandments.   Obey the law of sacrifice, which means sacrificing to support the Lord’s work and repenting with a broken heart and contrite spirit.   Obey the law of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which means:   Exercising faith in Jesus Christ.   Repenting daily.   Making covenants with God by receiving the ordinances of salvation and exaltation.   Enduring to the end by keeping covenants.   Striving to live the two great commandments. These are to “love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” and to “love thy neighbor as thyself” (Matthew 22:37,\\xa039).     Keep the law of chastity, which means abstaining from sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman, which is according to God’s law.   Keep the law of consecration, which means that members dedicate their time, talents, and everything with which the Lord has blessed them to building up Jesus Christ’s Church on the earth.

For Heavenly Father’s children to return to Him, each of them must repent, become worthy to receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, and honor the covenants associated with each ordinance. The ordinances of salvation and exaltation are:   Baptism.   Confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost.   Conferral of the Melchizedek Priesthood and ordination to an office (for men).   The temple endowment (including the initiatory).   Temple sealing.   Heavenly Father knew that many of His children would not receive these ordinances during their mortal lives. He provided another way for them to receive ordinances and make covenants with Him. In temples, ordinances can be performed by proxy. This means that a living person receives ordinances on behalf of someone who is deceased. In the spirit world, deceased persons can choose to accept or reject ordinances that have been performed for them (see Doctrine and Covenants 138:19, 32–34, 58–59). The ordinances of salvation and exaltation are not needed or performed for those who were not accountable in this life (see 18.1, 28.3.2, and 28.3.3). Church members are encouraged to identify deceased relatives who have not received the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. Members then perform the ordinances on behalf of those relatives.

Church members are blessed when they perform temple ordinances for the deceased. While performing proxy ordinances, they are able to reflect on their own temple covenants and their commitment to keep those covenants. Stake presidents and bishops help members prepare to have positive experiences performing temple ordinances.

Testimonies should be brief so that many people can participate. Young children are welcome to bear testimony in fast and testimony meeting. It may be best for them to learn to do so at home until they can bear testimony without help from others. Under the bishop’s direction, children are usually named and blessed during fast and testimony meeting (see 29.2.1.1).', 'title': 'Fast and Testimony Meeting', 'chapter': 'Meetings in the Church', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church?lang=eng', 'section': '29.2'}\n",

Frequency  Usually weekly (but may meet less often).   The bishop plans, presides over, and conducts ward council meetings. If he is absent, he may assign a counselor to preside and conduct. However, the council does not make major decisions without the bishop. The ward council seeks to help all ward members build spiritual strength, receive saving ordinances, keep covenants, and become consecrated followers of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 6:4–5). During ward council meetings, council members plan and coordinate this work. They determine together how the strengths and abilities of ward members can bless those in need. They seek the guidance of the Spirit as they unite in love and concern for members of the ward. Ward organization leaders attend ward council meetings in two capacities:   As members of the ward council who help bless all ward members.   As representatives of their organizations.   When they meet together, ward council members discuss matters that would benefit from unified efforts of the entire council. Each council member is encouraged to share his or her thoughts and inspiration on these matters. Ward council meetings usually do not last longer than one hour. They begin with a prayer and brief reports on assignments from previous meetings. Listed below are items that could be discussed. There is not enough time to discuss all of them in every meeting. The bishop gives priority to matters that are most needed to bless individuals and families.   Living the gospel of Jesus Christ. Helping all members build faith, receive saving ordinances, and keep their covenants.   Caring for those in need. Sharing resources and skills to bless individuals, families, and the community. Helping ward members become self-reliant. (See chapter\\xa022.)   Inviting all to receive the gospel. Reviewing the progress of those who are learning about the gospel, as well as new and returning members. Discussing ways members can share the gospel with others. (See chapter\\xa023.)   Uniting families for eternity. Reviewing the progress of members who are preparing to receive temple ordinances. Planning ways to help more members qualify for a temple recommend. Discussing ways members can participate in temple and family history work. (See chapter\\xa025.)   As ward council members discuss these matters, they consider the needs and strengths of the members they serve. They can learn about these needs and strengths in presidency meetings, in discussions with members of their organization (including ministering interviews), and through their own ministering efforts. In addition, Leader and Clerk Resources has tools and reports that can help leaders be aware of the progress of members. Council members must keep confidential any private or sensitive information (see 4.4.6). The ward council should know the children and youth in the ward and their home circumstances. They pay particular attention to those who do not have gospel support at home. After a discussion, the bishop may either decide on a course of action or postpone a decision while seeking additional information and guidance. Or he could refer the matter to a different council, such as the bishopric. See 4.4.3. Sometimes the ward council may determine that a ward activity could help meet the needs of members. The ward council may oversee the planning of ward activities. However, most of the planning is done before and after council meetings. For more information about activities, see chapter\\xa020. After full-time missionaries return home, they may be invited to report on their missions to the ward council (see 24.8.3).

Other sessions are for specific participants, as described below.    Frequency  Twice each year.   Stake conferences are scheduled by the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Usually the stake president presides at one conference each year and an assigned Area Seventy or General Authority presides at the other. The presiding officer directs all planning for the conference. He approves participants and musical selections in advance. For information about music in stake conference, see 19.3.4. When an Area Seventy or General Authority presides, he may invite the stake president to suggest topics for instruction at the conference. When the stake president presides, he and his counselors select topics. The stake presidency may discuss possible topics with the stake council. In making these selections, the stake presidency considers topics that the First Presidency has emphasized recently. As the stake president makes arrangements for stake conference, he may ask priesthood quorums and other organizations, individuals, and families to help. For example, they could be assigned to set up chairs, provide ushers, and clean the building. Each stake conference normally includes the following meetings:   A meeting of the Area Seventy or General Authority (if assigned) and the stake presidency. The stake clerk and executive secretary also attend.   A stake priesthood leadership meeting (see 29.3.3). The presiding authority determines whether this meeting is held on Saturday or Sunday. A member of the stake presidency conducts.   A Saturday evening session for all stake members 18\\xa0and older. Depending on local circumstances, this meeting may be held on Sunday if approved by the presiding authority. A member of the stake presidency conducts.   A general session, held on Sunday, for all members and others who would like to attend. The stake president conducts and speaks in this meeting. More than one Sunday general session may be held if there is not room for everyone in one session. Children attend with their families, not in a separate meeting.   If necessary, conference sessions may be streamed to meetinghouses or other locations in the stake. Some members may need the conference to be streamed to their homes. For more about streaming meetings, see 29.7. Speakers in the general session should not use visual aids or audiovisual materials (see 38.8.3). If General Officers, the temple president and matron, the mission president and companion, or the stake patriarch attend, they should sit on the stand. The same is true for counselors in temple and mission presidencies (and their spouses) if they attend in the place of the temple or mission president. In one stake conference each year, a member of the stake presidency presents general, area, and stake officers for sustaining. He uses the Officers Sustained form, prepared by the stake clerk. This is usually done in the first stake conference of the year. If stake officers are called or released between stake conferences, they are presented for sustaining or an expression of thanks in the next stake conference. Or this can be done in each ward’s sacrament meeting. See 30.3 and 30.6. Brethren who have been recommended to be ordained elders or high priests are presented for sustaining in a stake conference. If a brother needs to be ordained before the next stake conference, he may be sustained in his ward’s sacrament meeting.

Likewise, the Lord calls men and women to serve in the Church today through inspired invitations from His servants. These opportunities to serve are known as callings. Callings give members opportunities to feel the joy of serving God by serving His children (see Mosiah 2:17). Callings also help members increase their faith and draw closer to the Lord. It is not appropriate to aspire to specific callings in the Church (see Mark 10:42–45; Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–37). Nor do Church members “advance” from one calling to another. After serving in one calling, they should not expect to receive a calling of greater responsibility or prominence. Serving faithfully in a calling is more important than what the calling is. The Lord honors the dedication of all who serve in His Church. This chapter describes how members are called to serve in the Church and how they are released from their callings.

The member’s personal circumstances, including his or her health and work.   The impact the calling may have on the member’s marriage and family.   Each calling should bless the people who are served, the member who serves, and the member’s family. Callings also give members opportunities to grow. Members are blessed for sacrifices they make to serve in the Church. However, a calling should not place undue burdens on individuals and families. Nor should callings make it difficult for members to fulfill their employment responsibilities. Generally, each member is called to serve in only one calling at a time, in addition to being a ministering brother or sister. Exceptions should be rare and prayerfully considered. Not every potential position needs to be filled. When extending a calling to a married member, leaders ensure that the spouse is aware and supportive of the calling. Before extending a calling to a young man or young woman, leaders obtain approval from a parent or guardian. Before a calling is extended, the bishop carefully reviews the person’s membership record to verify that it does not include an annotation or formal membership restrictions. If the calling needs to be extended before the membership record is in the ward, the bishop contacts the member’s previous bishop. Before a stake leader extends a calling, the person’s bishop is consulted to discuss the member’s worthiness and other circumstances that could influence his or her service (such as those described above).', 'title': 'General Guidelines', 'chapter': 'Callings in the Church', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/30-callings-in-the-church?lang=eng', 'section': '30.1'}\n",

      "{844: 'Jesus Christ often ministered to others one by one (see, for example, John 4:5–26; 3\\xa0Nephi 17:21). He loves each of God’s children. He helps them individually. As a Church leader and servant of Jesus Christ, you also have opportunities to help God’s children, individually, in their spiritual progress. One important way you can do this is through interviews and other one-on-one meetings. Some of your most meaningful service will happen one on one. In these settings, you can give Christlike love, lifting up “the hands which hang down” and strengthening “the feeble knees” (Doctrine and Covenants 81:5). In this chapter, the term interview refers to a meeting between a leader and an individual to determine whether the person should participate in an ordinance or receive a calling (see 31.2). In general, these interviews are conducted by a member of the bishopric or stake presidency. The term interview also refers to ministering interviews conducted by a member of the Relief Society or elders quorum presidency (see 21.3). In addition to these interviews, there are many other reasons a Church leader may meet with individual members (see 31.3). For example, the bishopric has regularly scheduled meetings with each youth in the ward (see 31.3.1). Even if you do not serve in a bishopric, the bishop may ask you to meet with a member who is in need to provide ongoing support and ministering. Or a member may come to you when he or she is facing a personal or family challenge. This chapter can help all leaders who have opportunities to meet with individual members. These leaders can include Relief Society, elders quorum, and Young Women leaders, ministering brothers and sisters, or others the bishop assigns.', 'title': 'Introduction', 'chapter': 'Interviews and Other Meetings with Members', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/31?lang=eng', 'section': '31.0'}\n",

He can help you remember teachings you have studied in the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets that can help the person you are meeting with (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:85; 100:5–8). The Gospel Library has a collection of Counseling Resources. As you prepare to meet with a member, consider reviewing information about topics that apply to him or her. The Holy Ghost can also guide the member with whom you are meeting. You might consider inviting him or her to prepare spiritually for your meeting as well. Consider praying with the member as you begin the meeting. This can invite a spirit of humility and faith as you unitedly ask God for His help (see Doctrine and Covenants 6:32; 29:6). During the interview or meeting, an issue or question may arise that you don’t feel prepared to address. You might suggest that you and the member each seek the Lord’s guidance—for example, through study, prayer, and fasting. You might also refer to relevant information in Counseling Resources or Life Help in the Gospel Library. Then you can meet again to discuss the matter further.

This love can strengthen them and inspire them to come unto Christ, repent of sin, and make good choices. The scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets invite the Spirit and teach pure doctrine. Use them often, with sensitivity and love, when you meet with members.

When meeting with a member of the opposite sex, a child, or a youth, ensure that a parent or another adult is present. He or she may join the meeting or wait outside the room, depending on the preferences of the member with whom you are meeting. If meeting at the meetinghouse makes the member uncomfortable, decide together on a different place to meet. Find a place where the Holy Ghost can be present and you can keep confidences. Also consider your own safety and the safety of the member. For information about meeting with members virtually, see 31.4. Another important part of helping members feel safe is keeping confidences. Reassure the member that your conversation will be confidential. Do not share confidential information with anyone—including your spouse or other Church leaders—unless the member gives permission. Continue to keep such matters confidential even after you are released. Breaking confidences can harm a member’s faith, trust, and testimony. Members are more likely to seek help from Church leaders if they know that what they share will be kept confidential.

Only the bishop or stake president can help a person resolve serious sins. Some of these are listed in 32.6. If the member has committed any of these sins, he or she should meet with the bishop or stake president right away. Each bishop and stake president is “a judge in Israel” (Doctrine and Covenants 107:72). By this authority they help members repent of sin and come unto Christ, who forgives sin (see 32.1 and 32.3). In these responsibilities, these leaders represent the Lord. They strive to use “the judgment which [He] shall give unto [them]” (3\\xa0Nephi 27:27). They teach that repentance includes exercising faith in Jesus Christ, having a contrite spirit, forsaking sin, seeking forgiveness, making restitution, and keeping the commandments with renewed commitment. To help them fulfill their role, bishops and stake presidents are blessed with the spiritual gift of discernment. This gift helps them discern truth, understand a member’s heart, and identify his or her needs (see 1\\xa0Kings 3:6–12; Doctrine and Covenants 46:27–28). Although confession occurs with a “judge in Israel,” with permission of the member, other leaders can give support in his or her efforts to repent.

Our sins make us unclean—unworthy to dwell in the presence of our Heavenly Father. They also bring us anguish in this life. God’s law of justice requires a consequence when we sin (see Alma 42:14, 17–18). However, His great plan of mercy “can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles [us] in the arms of safety” (Alma 34:16; see also Mosiah 15:9). To bring about His plan of mercy, Heavenly Father sent His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins (see Alma 42:15). Jesus suffered the penalty that the law of justice requires for our sins (see Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–19; see also Alma 42:24–25). Through this sacrifice, both the Father and the Son showed Their infinite love for us (see John 3:16). When we exercise “faith unto repentance,” Heavenly Father forgives us, granting mercy through the Atonement of Jesus Christ (Alma 34:15; see also Alma 42:13). When we are cleansed and forgiven, we can ultimately inherit the kingdom of God (see Isaiah 1:18; Doctrine and Covenants 58:42). Repentance is more than changing behavior. It is turning away from sin and toward Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. It leads to a change of heart and mind (see Mosiah 5:2; Alma 5:12–14; Helaman 15:7). Through repentance, we become new persons, reconciled to God (see 2\\xa0Corinthians 5:17–18; Mosiah 27:25–26).

When a person falls short, he or she exercises faith in Jesus Christ and repents, relying on His mercy to strengthen and forgive. If a member commits a serious sin, the bishop or stake president helps him or her repent. As part of this process, he may need to restrict some Church membership privileges for a time. In some situations, he may need to withdraw a person’s membership for a time. Restricting or withdrawing a person’s membership is not intended to punish. Rather, these actions are sometimes necessary to help a person repent and experience a change of heart. They also give a person time to prepare spiritually to renew and keep his or her covenants again. The bishop or stake president oversees membership restrictions or withdrawal as outlined in 32.5–32.14. These actions are accompanied by conditions of repentance. As a person sincerely repents, he or she may have the privileges of Church membership restored. When membership restrictions or withdrawal is necessary, the bishop or stake president follows the guidance of the Holy Ghost and the instructions in this chapter. He acts in a spirit of love (see 32.3). Church membership restrictions are ecclesiastical, not civil or criminal. They affect only a person’s standing in the Church.

This includes sincere remorse for sins and their consequences (see 2\\xa0Corinthians 7:9–10). When a person commits a serious sin, membership restrictions or withdrawal can help foster a broken heart and contrite spirit needed to repent, truly forsake the sin, and understand the consequences of sin. This understanding can help people value their covenants with God more deeply and desire to keep those covenants in the future.', 'title': 'Help a Person Access the Redeeming Power of Jesus Christ through Repentance', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.2'}\n",

      "{879: 'Imagebishop talking to man Bishops and stake presidents are called and set apart to be judges in Israel (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:72–74). They hold priesthood keys to represent the Lord in helping Church members repent (see Doctrine and Covenants 13:1; 107:16–18). Often bishops and stake presidents assist with repentance through personal counseling. This assistance may include informally restricting some privileges of Church membership for a time. (See 32.8.) For some serious sins, leaders assist with repentance by holding a membership council (see 32.6 and 32.9–32.14). This assistance may include formally restricting some privileges of Church membership or withdrawing a person’s membership for a time (see 32.11.3 and 32.11.4). Bishops and stake presidents help Church members understand that God loves His children. Because He wants them to be happy and receive blessings, He also cares immensely about their obedience and repentance. Bishops and stake presidents are loving and caring as they help members repent. The Savior’s interaction with the woman taken in adultery is a guide (see John 8:3–11). Although He did not say her sins were forgiven, He did not condemn her. Instead, He told her to “sin no more”—to repent and change her life. These leaders teach that there is “joy … in heaven over one sinner that repenteth” (Luke 15:7). They are patient, supportive, and positive. They inspire hope. They teach and testify that because of the Savior’s atoning sacrifice, all can repent and become clean. Bishops and stake presidents seek guidance from the Spirit to know how to help each person repent. Only for the most serious sins does the Church have a set standard on what actions its leaders should take (see 32.6 and 32.11). No two situations are the same. The counseling that leaders give and the process of repentance they facilitate must be inspired and may be different for each person. The Lord knows each person’s circumstances, capacity, and spiritual maturity. The Holy Ghost will help leaders discern how to help members make the necessary changes so they can heal and resist the temptation to repeat the sin. Helping someone repent, turn back to God, and be healed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ is one of the most joyous experiences a person can have. Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–13 explains: “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; “For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. “And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance. “And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!”', 'title': 'The Role of Judges in Israel', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.3'}\n",

      "{881: 'Repentance requires that sins be confessed to Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ said, “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them” (Doctrine and Covenants 58:43; see also Mosiah 26:29). When Church members commit serious sins, their repentance also includes confession to their bishop or stake president. He is then able to exercise the keys of the gospel of repentance on their behalf (see Doctrine and Covenants 13:1; 84:26–27; 107:18,\\xa020). This helps them heal and return to the gospel path through the power of the Savior’s Atonement. The purpose of confession is to encourage members to unburden themselves so they can fully seek the Lord’s help in changing and healing. Developing a “broken heart and a contrite spirit” is aided by confession (2\\xa0Nephi 2:7). Voluntary confession shows that a person desires to repent. When a member confesses, the bishop or stake president follows the guidelines for counseling in 32.8. He prayerfully seeks guidance about the appropriate setting for helping the member repent (see 32.5). He considers whether a membership council would be helpful. If Church policy requires a membership council, he explains this (see 32.6 and 32.10). Sometimes a member has wronged a spouse or another adult. As part of repentance, he or she should usually confess to that person and seek forgiveness. A youth who commits a serious sin is usually encouraged to counsel with his or her parents.', 'title': 'Confession', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.4'}\n",
      "{882: 'A bishop or stake president typically learns about a serious sin through confession or from another person. He may also receive promptings about a potential serious sin through the Holy Ghost. If he feels prompted by the Spirit that someone may be struggling with sin, he may schedule an interview. During the interview, he shares his concerns in a kind, respectful way. He avoids any tone of accusation. If a member denies committing a serious sin that the bishop or stake president has information to support, a membership council may still be held. However, a spiritual impression alone is not sufficient to hold a council (see Doctrine and Covenants 10:37). The leader may gather additional information if needed. He follows the guidelines in 32.4.3 and 32.10.2.', 'title': 'Serious Sins That Are Not Confessed or Are Denied', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.4'}\n",
      "{883: 'Before holding a membership council, the bishop or stake president gathers as much information as he needs. Information from a member’s confession is often sufficient. Information may also come from a family member, another Church leader, a victim, or a participant in the sin. When gathering information, the bishop or stake president should only use methods that are appropriate for a priesthood leader. He should not keep a watch on a person’s home or record him or her without consent. Nor should he use any practices that are against the law. False accusations are rare but can occur. Priesthood leaders should be cautious when there is limited information besides one person’s word. For example, a member who is accused of adultery may deny the charge. The scriptures explain that “every word shall be established against him or her by two witnesses of the church” (Doctrine and Covenants 42:80). “Two witnesses” means two separate sources of information. This could include the knowledge of a participant and some other reliable source. At times a priesthood leader may need to wait to act until more information becomes available. When a Church leader is gathering information for a membership council, he should immediately stop if he learns that law enforcement is actively investigating the member. This is done to avoid possible claims that the leader may have obstructed justice. For legal advice about these situations in the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the Church’s Office of General Counsel: 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301 1-801-240-6301 Outside the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office. Normally a membership council is not held to consider conduct being examined by a civil or criminal trial court until the court has reached a final judgment.

      "{884: 'Bishops, stake presidents, and their counselors have a sacred duty to protect all confidential information shared with them. This information may come in interviews, counseling, and confessions. The same duty of confidentiality applies to all who take part in membership councils. Confidentiality is essential because members may not confess sins or seek guidance if what they share will not be kept confidential. Breaching a confidence betrays members’ trust and causes them to lose confidence in their leaders. Consistent with their duty of confidentiality, a bishop, stake president, or their counselors may share such information only as follows:   They need to confer with the member’s stake president, mission president, or bishop about holding a membership council or related matters. The stake president may also confer with his assigned Area Seventy. If needed, the Area Seventy refers the stake president to the Area Presidency. Only the stake president decides if a council should be held or its outcome.   The person moves to a new ward (or the priesthood leader is released) while membership action or other serious concerns are pending. In these cases, the leader notifies the new bishop or stake president about the concerns or pending action (see 32.14.7). He also informs the leader if the member may pose a threat to others.   A bishop or stake president learns that a Church member who lives outside the ward or stake may have been involved in a serious sin. In that instance, he confidentially contacts that member’s bishop.   It is necessary to disclose information during a membership council. All information gathered and shared as part of a membership council is confidential.   A member chooses to give permission for the leader to share information with specific persons. These may include parents, Church leaders, or others who may provide support. The leader does not share information beyond the permission the member has given.   It may be necessary to share limited information about the decision of a membership council (see 32.12.2).   In all other situations, the leader should refer to 32.4.5. These cases include when the law may require that a crime, such as child abuse, be reported to government authorities. To assist leaders in protecting others and complying with the law, the Church provides help from trained professionals. To receive this guidance, leaders promptly call the Church’s abuse help line where it is available (see 32.4.5 and 38.6.2.1). Where it is not available, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office. In only one situation should a bishop or stake president disclose confidential information without first seeking such guidance. That is when disclosure is necessary to prevent life-threatening harm or serious injury and there is not time to seek guidance. In such cases, the duty to protect others is more important than the duty of confidentiality. Leaders should contact civil authorities immediately. If leaders keep notes or communicate with each other electronically, they safeguard access to this information. They also delete or destroy the information when they no longer need it. They do not unnecessarily share personal information. Civil authorities might challenge the confidentiality required of a priesthood leader. If this occurs in the United States and Canada, the stake president seeks legal advice from the Church’s Office of General Counsel: 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301 1-801-240-6301 Outside the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office.', 'title': 'Confidentiality', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.4'}\n",

For example, some states and countries require that child abuse be reported to law enforcement authorities. In some countries, the Church has established a confidential abuse help line to assist bishops and stake presidents. These leaders should promptly call the help line about every situation in which a person may have been abused—or is at risk of being abused (see 38.6.2.1). It is available 24\\xa0hours a day, 7\\xa0days a week.

Personal counseling and informal restrictions by the bishop or stake president are sometimes not sufficient to help a person repent of serious sins. The Lord has provided membership councils to assist a judge in Israel in these situations. (See Exodus 18:12–27; Mosiah 26:29–36; Doctrine and Covenants 42:80–83;\\xa0102.) For some serious sins, a council is required by Church policy (see 32.6.1). Violating temple covenants increases the likelihood of a membership council being necessary (see 32.7.4). In a ward, the bishop’s counselors assist in membership councils. In a stake, the stake president’s counselors assist. In some stake membership councils, the high council also participates (see 32.9.2).

Do not ask for details beyond what is necessary to understand the situation. Do not ask questions that arise from personal curiosity.   Ask how the conduct has affected others.   Focus on positive conditions that deepen the member’s conversion and commitment to the Lord. Encourage the member to take specific actions to bring about the change of behavior and change of heart to repent. Invite him or her to draw close to the Savior, seeking His strength and to feel of His redeeming love.   Encourage uplifting activities such as praying, studying the scriptures, and attending Church meetings. Teach that family history and temple work can reduce the influence of the adversary. Encourage serving others and sharing the gospel.

Help members take preventive action to resist specific temptations.   Recognize that you are an ecclesiastical leader, not a professional counselor. In addition to the counseling you provide, some members would benefit from behavioral counseling. Some suffer from mental illness. As needed, counsel members to seek help from qualified medical and mental health professionals (see 31.3.6).   Be prayerful and seek guidance from the Spirit before giving informal membership restrictions. Some members may benefit from exercising the privileges of Church membership more actively rather than having them restricted.   Follow up to give encouragement, fortify spiritual strength, and monitor progress.   After a member has confessed to a bishop or stake president, follow-up counseling may occur in several ways. The leader himself can provide it. Or, with the member’s permission, he may assign one of his counselors to provide it. With the member’s consent, a bishop or stake president may assign members of the elders quorum or Relief Society to assist in specific ways. For youth, he may assign the Young Women presidency or Aaronic Priesthood quorum advisers to assist. Those who are assigned to assist are entitled to inspiration to fulfill that assignment (see 4.2.6). When assigning someone to assist with follow-up counseling, the leader gives only enough information necessary to help the member. The assigned person must maintain confidentiality.

Leaders seek the guidance of the Spirit about which restrictions would best help a person repent. These could include (but are not limited to) suspending the privilege of serving in a Church calling, exercising the priesthood, or entering a temple. The leader could also restrict the person from giving a talk, lesson, or prayer in Church settings. If the leader suspends the right to enter a temple, he cancels the temple recommend in Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR). Partaking of the sacrament is an important part of repentance. It should not be the first restriction given to a repentant person who has a broken heart and contrite spirit.

      "{961: 'If a member asks to resign his or her membership in the Church, the bishop reaches out to see if he or she is willing to discuss the concerns and try to resolve them. The bishop and member may also counsel with the stake president. The leader ensures that the member understands the following results of resigning Church membership:   It revokes all ordinances.   It removes all membership privileges.   Readmission by baptism and confirmation can occur only after a thorough interview and, in many cases, a membership council (see 32.16.2).   A previously endowed person is eligible to receive a restoration of priesthood and temple blessings only with First Presidency approval and after at least one full year from readmission (see 32.17.2).   If the member still wants to resign Church membership, he or she gives the bishop a written, signed request. The bishop submits the request to the stake president through LCR. The stake president then reviews and submits the request through that system. Leaders should act on requests promptly. A person can also resign membership by sending a signed, notarized request to Church headquarters. A minor who wishes to resign his or her Church membership follows the same procedure as an adult, with one exception: the request should be signed by the minor (if over the age of\\xa08) and by the parent(s) or guardian(s) who have legal custody of the minor. If a member resigning membership threatens legal action against the Church or its leaders, the stake president follows the instructions in 38.8.23. A request to resign membership should be acted on even if priesthood leaders have information about a serious sin. Any information about unresolved sins is noted when the request is submitted through LCR. This allows priesthood leaders to resolve such matters in the future if the person applies for readmission into the Church (see 32.16.2). A priesthood leader should not recommend resigning Church membership in order to avoid holding a membership council. Leaders continue to minister to those who resign their membership unless they request no contact.', 'title': 'Requests to Resign Membership', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.14'}\n",

He continues to minister, as the person allows, so he or she may again enjoy the blessings of Church membership. The bishop regularly meets with the person and, when helpful and applicable, his or her spouse. The Savior taught the Nephites: “Ye shall not cast him out of … your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them” (3\\xa0Nephi 18:32). The time just after a person’s membership has been restricted or withdrawn is difficult and critical for his or her family. Leaders should be sensitive to these needs and encourage and assist family members. The bishop ensures that caring members are assigned to minister to a person whose Church membership has been restricted or withdrawn, as the person allows. They also minister to other family members. Individuals under membership restrictions may benefit from participating in indexing (see 25.4.3). If the person moves from the ward, the bishop informs the new bishop and explains what still needs to occur before Church membership restrictions can be removed. If the person’s membership was withdrawn from the Church or the person resigned membership, the bishop makes this same contact if the person has consented to be assisted by Church leaders.', 'title': 'Continue to Minister', 'chapter': 'Repentance and Church Membership Councils', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng', 'section': '32.15'}\n",

      "{964: 'When membership privileges are restricted or withdrawn in a membership council, another council must be held to consider removing the restrictions or readmitting the person to the Church. This council should also have the same level of authority (or higher) as the initial council. For example, if a stake or mission president presided over the initial council, a stake or mission president presides over the council to consider removing the restrictions or readmitting the person. The current bishop or stake president holds the council. He first ensures that the person has repented and is ready and worthy to enjoy the blessings of Church membership. Those who have had their Church membership formally restricted usually need to show genuine repentance for at least one year before consideration is given to removing the restrictions. Those who have had their Church membership withdrawn almost always need to show genuine repentance for at least one year before they can be considered for readmission. For a member who held a prominent Church position at the time of the serious sin, the period is generally longer (see 32.6.1.4). A council to consider removing restrictions or readmitting a person to the Church follows the same guidelines as other membership councils. A bishop needs approval from the stake president to hold the council. In a mission, a branch or district president needs approval from the mission president. The following guidelines apply when holding a membership council to consider removing Church membership restrictions or readmitting a person to the Church. Not all of these guidelines may apply in each case.   Review the initial membership council. The bishop or stake president reviews the Report of Church Membership Council form. He requests a copy through LCR. After reviewing the form, he may contact the bishop or stake president where the initial council was held to seek clarification.   Interview the person. The bishop or stake president interviews the person thoroughly to discern the strength of his or her faith in Jesus Christ and the extent of repentance. He also determines whether the person has met the conditions outlined in the initial action.   Determine the status of criminal or civil court action. Sometimes a person has admitted to or has been convicted of a crime. Sometimes a person has been found liable in a civil action of fraud or other illegal acts. In these cases, the leader generally does not hold a council until the person has fulfilled all the conditions of any sentence, order, or judgment made by legal authorities. These conditions may include imprisonment, probation, parole, and fines or restitution. Exceptions require the approval of the First Presidency before holding a membership council. These exceptions might include someone who has completed legal requirements and has shown genuine repentance but is on lifelong probation or has a substantial fine.   Contact the priesthood leaders of the victims. The bishop or stake president contacts the current bishop or stake president of any victims (see 32.10.2).   Give notice of the council. He notifies the person of the date, time, and place of the council.   Conduct the council. He conducts the council according to the guidelines in 32.10.3. He asks the person what he or she has done to repent. He also asks about his or her commitment to Jesus Christ and the Church. When all relevant matters have been presented, he excuses the member. With his counselors, he prays to consider what action to take. The three possible decisions are:   Continue membership restrictions or withdrawal.   Remove restrictions or authorize readmission.   Recommend to the First Presidency that restrictions be removed or readmission be authorized (if necessary according to “Apply for First Presidency approval” below).     Share the decision. After the council makes a decision, the presiding officer shares it with the person. If approval from the First Presidency is necessary, he explains that the decision is a recommendation to the First Presidency.   Submit a report. The bishop or stake president submits a Report of Church Membership Council form through LCR. He may ask the clerk to prepare this report. He ensures that no hard copy or electronic copy is retained locally. He also ensures that all notes used to prepare the report are promptly destroyed.   Apply for First Presidency approval (if necessary). In the following circumstances, the approval of the First Presidency is necessary to remove formal membership restrictions or readmit the person into the Church. This approval is required even if the conduct occurred after Church membership was formally restricted or withdrawn. The stake president submits an application to the First Presidency only if he recommends approval (see 6.2.3).

The bishop or stake president ensures that the person receives prompt written notice of the decision and its effects.   Baptize and confirm. If a person’s Church membership was withdrawn in the initial council, he or she must be baptized and confirmed again. If First Presidency approval is necessary, these ordinances may be performed only after this approval is received.

      "{965: 'If a person formally resigns Church membership, he or she must be baptized and confirmed to be readmitted into the Church. For adults, readmission is not usually considered until at least one year after resigning membership. When a person requests readmission, the bishop or stake president obtains a copy of the Report of Administrative Action form that accompanied the request for resignation. He can obtain this through LCR. The bishop or stake president then interviews the person thoroughly. He asks about the reasons for the original request and the desire for readmission. In a spirit of love, he asks about serious sins the person may have committed either before or after resigning membership. The leader does not proceed with readmission until he is satisfied that the person has repented and is ready and worthy to enjoy the blessings of Church membership. Guidelines for readmission after resignation follow:   A membership council is held if the person’s membership was formally restricted at the time of resignation.   A membership council is held if the person committed a serious sin, including apostasy, before resigning membership.   In other circumstances, a membership council is not held unless the bishop or stake president determines that it would be needed. When a membership council is necessary for a person who had received the temple endowment, the stake president holds it. When a council is necessary for a person who was not endowed, the bishop holds it, with approval from the stake president. If the person engaged in any of the conduct in 32.16.1, number\\xa09, either before or after resigning Church membership, First Presidency approval is required for readmission. If the person engaged in any of the conduct in 32.14.5, number\\xa01, either before or after resigning membership, an annotation will be made on the membership record. A person who requests readmission must meet the same qualifications as others who are baptized.

In that case, the bishop or an assigned counselor contacts the prior bishop before conducting an interview to issue a temple recommend or to recommend ordination to a Melchizedek Priesthood office. The purpose of this contact is to ask if there are any worthiness matters to be considered. If a counselor learns that there is confidential information, he ends the conversation. He informs his bishop to contact the prior bishop before conducting the interview. Under no circumstances may membership records be given or shown to anyone other than the bishop or a clerk. Members may view membership information for themselves and for any dependent children living at home on the Member Tools app. They may also request printed copies of their Individual Ordinance Summaries from the clerk.

The stake or mission president may recommend creating a group in the following circumstances:   Travel for its potential members to meet with a ward or branch is difficult.   A small number of members speak a language that is different from those in the ward or branch.   Members in the military are best served by being in a group (see 38.9.4).   To propose creating a group, the stake or mission president submits a request to the Area Presidency. Only the Area Presidency can approve the request. A group must have at least two members. One must be a worthy priest in the Aaronic Priesthood or a worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holder. In stakes, the stake president assigns a bishop or branch president to organize and supervise the group. In missions, the mission president assigns a branch president to organize and supervise it. Generally, a group can be created to serve members who live in one or more units within a stake or district. Group membership is limited to those who live within the boundaries of the participating unit or units. Groups do not cross stake or district boundaries. The stake president, mission president, bishop, or branch president calls a group leader and sets him apart. The group leader organizes and conducts group meetings, which include the administration of the sacrament. A group leader does not hold priesthood keys, and he is not authorized to:   Receive tithes and offerings.   Counsel members about serious sin.   Give informal or formal membership restrictions.   Perform other duties that require priesthood keys.   Typically, groups use the Basic Unit Program (see 36.6). Membership records of group members are kept in the ward or branch that supervises the group. Church headquarters does not assign a unit number to groups.

For information about how to help someone who is suicidal or someone who has been affected by suicide, see suicide.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Most people who have thought about suicide want to find relief from physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual pain. Such individuals need love, help, and support from family, Church leaders, and qualified professionals. The bishop provides ecclesiastical support if a member is considering suicide or has attempted it. He also immediately helps the member obtain professional help. He encourages those close to the person to seek professional help as needed. Despite the best efforts of loved ones, leaders, and professionals, suicide is not always preventable. It leaves behind deep heartbreak, emotional upheaval, and unanswered questions for loved ones and others. Leaders should counsel and console the family. They provide nurturing and support. The family may also need professional support and counseling. It is not right for a person to take his or her own life. However, only God is able to judge the person’s thoughts, actions, and level of accountability (see 1\\xa0Samuel 16:7; Doctrine and Covenants 137:9). The family, in consultation with the bishop, determines the place and nature of a funeral service for the person. The family may choose to use Church facilities. If the person was endowed in life, he or she may be buried or cremated in temple clothing. Those who have lost a loved one to suicide can find hope and healing in Jesus Christ and His Atonement.

Members and nonmembers who identify as transgender—and their family and friends—should be treated with sensitivity, kindness, compassion, and an abundance of Christlike love. All are welcome to attend sacrament meeting, other Sunday meetings, and social events of the Church (see 38.1.1). Gender is an essential characteristic of Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness. The intended meaning of gender in the family proclamation is biological sex at birth. Some people experience feelings of incongruence between their biological sex and their gender identity. As a result, they may identify as transgender. The Church does not take a position on the causes of people identifying as transgender. Most Church participation and some priesthood ordinances are gender neutral. Transgender persons may be baptized and confirmed as outlined in 38.2.8.9. They may also partake of the sacrament and receive priesthood blessings. However, priesthood ordination and temple ordinances are received according to biological sex at birth. Church leaders counsel against elective medical or surgical intervention for the purpose of attempting to transition to the opposite gender of a person’s biological sex at birth (“sex reassignment”). Leaders advise that taking these actions will be cause for Church membership restrictions. Leaders also counsel against social transitioning. A social transition includes changing dress or grooming, or changing a name or pronouns, to present oneself as other than his or her biological sex at birth. Leaders advise that those who socially transition will experience some Church membership restrictions for the duration of this transition. Restrictions include receiving or exercising the priesthood, receiving or using a temple recommend, and receiving some Church callings. Although some privileges of Church membership are restricted, other Church participation is welcomed. Transgender individuals who do not pursue medical, surgical, or social transition to the opposite gender and are worthy may receive Church callings, temple recommends, and temple ordinances. Some children, youth, and adults are prescribed hormone therapy by a licensed medical professional to ease gender dysphoria or reduce suicidal thoughts. Before a person begins such therapy, it is important that he or she (and the parents of a minor) understands the potential risks and benefits. If these members are not attempting to transition to the opposite gender and are worthy, they may receive Church callings, temple recommends, and temple ordinances. If a member decides to change his or her preferred name or pronouns of address, the name preference may be noted in the preferred name field on the membership record. The person may be addressed by the preferred name in the ward. Circumstances vary greatly from unit to unit and person to person. Members and leaders counsel together and with the Lord. Area Presidencies will help local leaders sensitively address individual situations. Bishops counsel with the stake president.

He first verifies the man’s worthiness with his bishop and stake president. If a Latter-day Saint chaplain is in the area, the priesthood leader can authorize him to call and set apart a group leader. Service member group leaders in isolated locations may obtain Church supplies and materials by contacting the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division (see 38.9.10). Sometimes a deployed service member is isolated from other Church members. If the service member holds the Melchizedek Priesthood or is a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, his bishop may authorize him to administer and partake of the sacrament. If there is more than one member at a deployed location, a group leader should be called. The Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division should be notified when a group leader is called. A letter of appointment will be sent to him (see 38.9.1.1).', 'title': 'Group Leaders in Remote Areas or War Zones', 'chapter': 'Church Policies and Guidelines', 'url': 'https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng', 'section': '38.9'}\n",
