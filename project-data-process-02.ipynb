      "2.1.2 Husband and Wife Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 49:15 ). A husband and wife are intended to progress together toward eternal life (see 1 Corinthians 11:11 ). One of the requirements for obtaining eternal life is for a man and a woman to enter the covenant of celestial marriage (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ). A couple makes this covenant when they receive the marriage sealing ordinance in the temple. This covenant is the foundation of an eternal family. When faithfully kept, it allows their marriage to endure forever. Ultimately, they can become like God (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20 ). God has commanded husbands and wives to cleave to each other (see Genesis 2:24 ; Doctrine and Covenants 42:22 ). In this context, the word cleave means to be completely devoted and faithful to someone. Married couples cleave together by loving and serving each other. Cleaving also includes total fidelity between husband and wife. Physical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Tenderness and respect—not selfishness—should guide their intimate relationship. God has commanded that sexual intimacy is to be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. Remaining sexually pure before marriage and faithful within marriage helps individuals be truly happy and avoid spiritual, emotional, and physical harm. Parents and Church leaders are encouraged to do all they can to reinforce this teaching. (See 38.6.5 .) A couple seeks to be unified in establishing their family (see Genesis 2:24 ). Being united in marriage requires a full partnership, sharing responsibilities. A husband and wife are equal in God’s eyes. One should not dominate the other. Their decisions should be made in unity and love, with full participation of both. Adam and Eve set an example for husbands and wives. They worked, prayed, and worshipped together (see Moses 5:1, 4 ). They taught their children the gospel and mourned together over their trials (see Moses 5:12, 27 ). They were united with each other and with God.\n",

      "Lenght: 2735\n",
      "2.1.3 Parents and Children God’s first commandment to Adam and Eve as husband and wife was to have children (see Genesis 1:28 ). Latter-day prophets have taught that “God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ”; see also Doctrine and Covenants 49:16–17 ). It is a sacred privilege and responsibility for a husband and wife to care for the children they are able to bear or adopt. Adoptive parents have the same blessings and responsibilities as biological parents. A loving husband and wife together provide the best setting for rearing and nurturing children. Individual circumstances may prevent parents from rearing their children together. However, the Lord will bless them as they seek His help and strive to keep their covenants with Him. Parents have the vital responsibility to help their children prepare to receive the blessings of eternal life. They teach their children to love and serve God and others (see Matthew 22:36–40 ). They teach them to pray to Heavenly Father and study the word of God (see Alma 37:36–37, 44–46 ). They help their children understand the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25 ). They also help them prepare to make covenants as they receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. “Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ”). When there is not a husband or father in the home, the mother presides over the family. Presiding in the family is the responsibility to help lead family members back to dwell in God’s presence. This is done by serving and teaching with gentleness, meekness, and pure love, following the example of Jesus Christ (see Matthew 20:26–28 ). Presiding in the family includes leading family members in regular prayer, gospel study, and other aspects of worship. Parents work in unity to fulfill these responsibilities. “Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ”). To nurture means to nourish, teach, and support, following the example of the Savior (see 3 Nephi 10:4 ). In unity with her husband, a mother helps her family learn gospel truths and develop faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Together they foster an environment of love in the family. “In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ”). They prayerfully counsel together and with the Lord.\n",

Teaching in the Savior’s way is more than talking; it includes listening and asking questions the way He did (see Matthew 16:13–17 ). Effective teachers are also diligent learners. Make the study of God’s word a high priority in your life. Gospel learning is a lifelong process. Teach from the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets (see Doctrine and Covenants 52:9 ). Remember that “the preaching of the word [has] more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than … anything else” ( Alma 31:5 ). Seek the influence of the Spirit as you prepare and teach. The Holy Ghost carries the truth unto the hearts and minds of those you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1 ).

Those who hold priesthood keys preside in their areas of responsibility, such as a quorum or ward. Other organizations in the Church, including the Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, and Sunday School, are also led by a presiding officer. These leaders are called, set apart, and given delegated authority by one who holds priesthood keys or someone he has authorized (see 3.4.3 ). Each presiding officer serves under the direction of a person who holds priesthood keys (see 3.4.1 ). This structure provides order and clear lines of responsibility and accountability in doing the Lord’s work. A presiding officer may delegate to another person a temporary assignment to preside. For example, if a Relief Society president will be absent from a Relief Society Sunday meeting, she would assign her first counselor to preside in the meeting. A leader who presides in a Church organization, meeting, or activity ensures that the Lord’s purposes are accomplished. In doing this, the leader follows gospel principles, Church policies, and the direction of the Holy Ghost. Those who preside follow the example of Jesus Christ in serving with gentleness, meekness, and pure love (see John 13:13–15 ). A calling or assignment to preside does not make the person who receives it more important or valued than others (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:109–10 ). If you have been called or assigned to preside, follow the Savior’s teaching that “whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant” ( Matthew 20:27 ; see verses 26–28 ).

Delegating is more than giving an assignment. It also includes teaching and trusting another person to fulfill the assignment. It usually includes the following elements: <ul> <li> <p>Meet with the person to invite him or her to serve the Lord in an assignment.

When considering who could serve in Church callings or assignments, be prayerful. Remember that the Lord will qualify those He calls.

Councils give special emphasis to helping members receive ordinances and keep the associated covenants. Council members also seek inspiration about planning and coordinating the Lord’s work in their area of responsibility. Some administrative business, such as calendar planning, may not require discussion in a council setting. Much of this can be handled through communication before and after meetings. Council members give particular care to individuals and families with pressing needs. Councils help coordinate assistance. For information about some of these needs, along with resources for understanding and assisting, see Life Help in the Gospel Library.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 536\n",
      "4.4.2 Preparation for Council Meetings Presidencies and councils are expected to meet regularly. Leaders seek the Lord’s guidance in planning council meetings. They also seek input from council members in deciding what to discuss. Leaders let council members know of the matters for discussion in advance. Council members prepare to share insights about these matters. For ward and stake councils, much of this preparation occurs in presidency meetings. Council members prepare themselves spiritually to participate in council meetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 2112\n",
      "4.4.3 Discussion and Decisions The Lord said, “Let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege” ( Doctrine and Covenants 88:122 ). This principle applies to Church councils. During a council meeting, the leader (or someone the leader assigns) explains the matter being considered. The leader then encourages discussion among all council members, asking questions and seeking ideas. The leader encourages members to speak openly and honestly. The diverse backgrounds, ages, experiences, and viewpoints of council members enrich the council. Members share suggestions and listen to each other respectfully. As they seek to know the Lord’s will, a spirit of inspiration and unity can prevail. In a council that includes women and men, the leader seeks insights and ideas from both. Women and men often have different perspectives that provide needed balance. Men and women reach better decisions and have greater success in the Lord’s service as they value each other’s contributions and work together. A leader guides the council’s discussions. However, he or she should listen more than talk. When a council leader shares his or her perspective too early, it can inhibit the contributions of others. When necessary, the council leader gently redirects or refocuses the discussion. After the discussion, the leader may either decide on a course of action or postpone a decision while seeking additional information and guidance. The decision should be informed by the discussion and confirmed by the Spirit. The council process helps bring about inspired decisions that go beyond a leader’s own best judgment. The leader may also refer the matter to a different council. Sometimes council members may have unsettled feelings about an important decision. When this happens, the leader may wait for another meeting to consider the matter further and seek spiritual confirmation and unity. In some cases, a council member may want to meet with the leader individually to discuss his or her concerns.\n",

      "4.4.4 Unity The Lord instructed His disciples to “be one” ( Doctrine and Covenants 38:27 ). Council members seek to become one in desire and purpose with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. They strive for unity in their discussions and decisions. Council members should avoid contention, unrighteous judgment, and gossip (see 3 Nephi 11:28–30 ). As they act in unity, Heavenly Father will bless their efforts.\n",

      "Lenght: 514\n",

The council leader invites members to fulfill assignments relating to these plans. Council members usually invite others in their organization to help. Individuals should not be overburdened with assignments. Council members report on their assignments. Progress usually requires sustained attention and follow-up assignments.\n",

The council respects the desires of any who request confidentiality. Council members should not share personal information outside the council unless required to fulfill an assignment from the council leader. Some matters are too sensitive to bring before an entire council. As appropriate, leaders review these matters with individual members of the council.

Since ancient days, the Lord has directed His people through prophets (see Amos 3:7 ; Ephesians 4:11–13 ). The President of the Church is a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is also the senior Apostle. Under the Lord’s direction, he presides over the Church and is the only person on earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys (see Matthew 16:16–19 ; see also 3.4.1.1 in this handbook). He has authority to receive revelation and declare the will of God for the whole Church. (See Doctrine and Covenants 43:2–3 ; 107:91–92 ; 128:11 .) First Presidency. Through the President of the Church, the Lord calls counselors to assist in the work. The President and his counselors are “three Presiding High Priests … [who] form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church” ( Doctrine and Covenants 107:22 ). This quorum is called the First Presidency. Members of the First Presidency are Apostles and as such are “special witnesses” of the name of Jesus Christ ( Doctrine and Covenants 107:23 ). The First Presidency presides over and directs all the affairs of the Church. Peter, James, and John fulfilled this role in the ancient Church. They were with the Savior on several sacred occasions and received the keys of the kingdom. (See Matthew 16:18–19 ; 17:1–5 ; Mark 14:32–42 ; Doctrine and Covenants 27:12–13 ; 81:1–2 .) When the President of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved. The counselors return to their positions of seniority within the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Under the direction of the senior Apostle, the Quorum of the Twelve leads the Church. As a quorum, they consider when the First Presidency should be reorganized. After unanimous decision, the senior Apostle is ordained as the new President of the Church and calls his counselors. Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Anciently, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles to help lead His Church (see Luke 6:12–13 ; Ephesians 4:11–13 ; 1 Nephi 13:40 ). In our day, the Lord calls men through the President of the Church to be ordained as Apostles and to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:26–28 ). This quorum acts under the direction of the First Presidency to build up and regulate the Church in all nations (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:33 ). Members of the Twelve proclaim the gospel in all the world (see Matthew 28:19–20 ; Doctrine and Covenants 107:35 ). Each Apostle holds all the keys of the kingdom and exercises those keys under the direction of the President of the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 112:30–32 ). The Twelve Apostles are “special witnesses” of the name of Jesus Christ ( Doctrine and Covenants 107:23 ; see also 27:12 ). They witness to all the world of His divinity and the reality of His Resurrection (see Acts 1:8, 22 ; 4:33 ; Doctrine and Covenants 76:22–24 ). Apostles serve full-time in the Church for the remainder of their lives (see Matthew 4:18–22 ). The Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. All members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. Together they form the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Under the direction of the Lord and by unanimous voice, this council has authority to declare and interpret doctrine and establish policy for the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 1:38 ; 107:27–31 ). 5.1.1.2 The Seventy The office of Seventy in the Melchizedek Priesthood is referenced in both the Old and New Testaments (see Exodus 24:1, 9–10 ; Numbers 11:16–17, 24–25 ; Luke 10:1, 17 ). Today, there are General Authority Seventies and Area Seventies (see 5.2.2 ). They act under the keys and direction of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They assist the Twelve in building up and regulating the Church in all nations (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:34–35, 38 ). Presidency of the Seventy . Seven members of the Seventy are called as presidents to preside over all members of the Seventy. One of the seven presidents is chosen to preside over the other six. They comprise the Presidency of the Seventy. (See Acts 6:2–6 ; Doctrine and Covenants 107:93–94 ; 124:138 .) General Authority Seventies. General Authority Seventies are called by the First Presidency to be special witnesses who bear record of the name of Jesus Christ and teach the gospel in all the world (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:25 ; 124:139 ). General Authority Seventies serve full-time in the Church. They are generally released in the year they turn 70 years old and are granted emeritus status. Although they retain the office of Seventy, they no longer preside in meetings. Quorums of the Seventy. Members of the Seventy, including Area Seventies, are organized into quorums. The Presidency of the Seventy presides over these quorums. The number of members of the Seventy and quorums of Seventy may increase with the growth of the Church. (See Doctrine and Covenants 107:95–96 ; 124:138–39 ). 5.1.1.3 Presiding Bishopric The Presiding Bishopric consists of the Presiding Bishop and his two counselors. Each member of the Presiding Bishopric is a General Authority and holds the office of bishop. They are called by the First Presidency and work under their direction. The Presiding Bishopric administers temporal matters, such as welfare, finances, physical facilities, and humanitarian efforts, for the entire Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 107:68 ).

      "7.1.4 Coordinating God’s Work of Salvation and Exaltation in the Ward The bishop coordinates God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward (see chapter 1 ). His counselors and other ward leaders assist him. The bishop helps members live the gospel. He helps them strengthen their faith in Heavenly Father and in Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:29 ). He teaches them to pray and study the scriptures. He invites them to make covenants by receiving the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. He encourages them to keep their covenants. The bishop strengthens Church members. He encourages families to participate in regular family prayer and learn the gospel together, including in home evening. He teaches them to love and serve one another. He teaches by word and example that Church callings can be fulfilled without detracting from family responsibilities. He ensures that Church activities support parents’ efforts to raise their children in righteousness. In addition to helping members live the gospel, the bishop has other responsibilities in coordinating God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward. For example, he: <ul> <li> <p>Helps men prepare to be ordained to priesthood offices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leads efforts to care for those in need in the ward (see <a>7.1.4.1</a> and <a>22.2.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Guides the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead ministering efforts in the ward (see <a>21.2.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordinates the work of the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward’s efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members (see <a>23.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordinates the efforts of the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead temple and family history work in the ward (see <a>25.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Helps members prepare to receive a temple recommend and temple ordinances (see <a>27.1</a>).</p> </li> </ul> 7.1.4.1 Leading Efforts to Care for Those with Temporal Needs The bishop has a divine mandate to seek out and care for those with temporal needs (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:112 ). He delegates much of this work to the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies. Some duties are performed only by the bishop. For example, he determines the type, amount, and duration of any temporal assistance provided by the Church. In doing so, he often consults with the Relief Society and elders quorum presidents. For more information, see 22.4 and 22.5 . Members of the bishopric teach the principles of caring for those in need and building self-reliance (see 22.1 ). They also teach the law of the fast (see 22.2.2 ). They oversee the gathering of fast offerings (see 34.3.2 ). The bishop instructs other ward leaders in their responsibilities to care for those in need. He also leads the ward council in these efforts.

See 1.2.1 . 8.2.1.1 Gospel Learning at Home When members learn and live the gospel at home, their conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ deepens. Elders quorum leaders encourage brethren to study the scriptures and the words of living prophets, individually and with their families. Come, Follow Me and other resources can supplement their study. Home evenings are an important way to learn the gospel at home. They are usually held weekly on Sunday, on Monday evening, or at another time. They could include prayers, gospel study, testimonies, singing, and fun activities.

Then a member of the presidency leads the quorum members in counseling together for five to ten minutes about relevant challenges, needs, and opportunities. Focusing on the Savior in this counseling will help quorum members build testimonies, receive temple ordinances, keep covenants, and increase discipleship. The elders quorum presidency selects topics to counsel about based on the needs of the quorum members. Sufficient time should then be given to meaningful gospel instruction and discussion. The focus should be on topics in one or more talks from the most recent general conference. The elders quorum presidency prayerfully selects conference messages for quorum members to discuss. They make these selections based on members’ needs. Hymns may be sung to enhance a lesson. Meetings should end with a prayer. The elders quorum and Relief Society may occasionally combine for a Sunday lesson. These meetings are coordinated by the bishopric and the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies. For more information, see “ To Sit in Council .” 8.2.1.3 Activities Elders quorum presidencies may plan activities. The president oversees activities. He may ask a counselor or another quorum member to take the lead in planning and carrying them out (see 8.3.5 ). Presidencies discuss activities with the bishop as part of their planning. Activities should strengthen quorum members’ desires to make and keep covenants and give them opportunities to gather and serve together.

For more information about how members of the elders quorum and Relief Society care for those in need, see 22.6.2 . 8.2.2.1 Ministering Ministering is caring for others as the Savior would. Members of the elders quorum receive ministering assignments from the quorum presidency. For more information, see chapter 21 . 8.2.2.2 Short-Term Needs Ministering brothers seek to understand and respond to the needs of those they serve. Members may need short-term assistance at times of illness, births, deaths, job loss, and other circumstances. When needed, ministering brothers ask the elders quorum presidency for help. With the bishop’s approval, the presidency may call a service coordinator to organize these efforts (see 8.3.5 ). The elders quorum and Relief Society coordinate efforts to address short-term needs (see 22.3.2 ). The bishop may provide fast-offering assistance if needed. In some locations, bishops have the option to provide members in need with a bishop’s order for food and other basic goods. The bishop generally assigns the Relief Society president to meet with the members and fill out the order form. However, he may also assign the elders quorum president. A counselor in the Relief Society or elders quorum presidency may be assigned if the president is unavailable. The assigned leader submits the completed form to the bishop for his approval. For more information, see 22.6.2 and “ Welfare Resources ” in Leader and Clerk Resources. 8.2.2.3 Long-Term Needs and Self-Reliance As coordinated by the bishop, the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies help members with long-term needs and self-reliance. They teach principles of temporal and spiritual self-reliance. See chapter 22 and “ Self-Reliance ” in the Gospel Library app. If a person or family needs assistance, the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents counsel together, as coordinated by the bishop, about how to help (see 22.4 ). The elders quorum president, Relief Society president, or another leader helps the person or family develop a Self-Reliance Plan . Ministering brothers or sisters can also help with the plan. Often, other members of the elders quorum or Relief Society have skills or experience that can help. All who assist treat information with confidentiality. For more information, see 22.3.3 and 22.8 . 8.2.2.4 When a Ward Member Dies When a ward member dies, elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies offer comfort and assistance. Under the bishop’s guidance, they can help with the funeral. If possible, deceased members who were endowed are buried or cremated in temple clothing. The body of a man may be dressed by his wife or by an endowed male family member. If a family member is not available or would prefer not to do the dressing, the bishop may ask the elders quorum president to invite an endowed man to dress the body or oversee the dressing.

They emphasize exercising faith, repenting, increasing in self-reliance, and making covenants with God by receiving ordinances. Such ordinances include the temple endowment. See 1.2.1 . 9.2.1.1 Gospel Learning at Home When members learn and live the gospel at home, their conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ deepens. Relief Society leaders encourage sisters to study the scriptures and the words of living prophets, individually and with their families. Come, Follow Me and other resources can supplement their study. Home evenings are an important way to learn the gospel at home. They are usually held weekly on Sunday, on Monday evening, or at another time. They could include prayers, gospel study, testimonies, singing, and fun activities. 9.2.1.2 Gospel Learning in Relief Society Meetings Relief Societies meet on Sundays for the following purposes: <ul> <li> <p>Strengthen faith.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build unity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strengthen families and homes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordinate efforts to assist God in His work of salvation and exaltation in the ward.</p> </li> </ul> Meetings are held on the second and fourth Sundays of the month.

Then a member of the presidency leads the sisters in counseling together for five to ten minutes about relevant challenges, needs, and opportunities. Focusing on the Savior in this counseling will help sisters build testimonies, receive temple ordinances, keep covenants, and increase their discipleship. The Relief Society presidency selects topics to counsel about based on the needs of the sisters. Sufficient time should then be given to meaningful gospel instruction and discussion. The focus should be on topics in one or more talks from the most recent general conference. The Relief Society presidency prayerfully selects conference messages for the sisters to discuss. They make these selections based on sisters’ needs. Hymns may be sung to enhance a lesson. Meetings should end with a prayer. The Relief Society and elders quorum may occasionally combine for a Sunday lesson. These meetings are coordinated by the bishopric and the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies. For more information, see “ To Sit in Council .” 9.2.1.3 Activities Relief Society presidencies may plan activities. The president oversees activities. She may ask a counselor or another sister to take the lead in planning and carrying them out (see 9.3.4 ). Presidencies discuss activities with the bishop as part of their planning. Activities should strengthen sisters’ desires to make and keep covenants and give them opportunities to gather and serve together. Activities should help accomplish the purposes of the Relief Society (see 9.1 and 9.1.1 ). For information about stake Relief Society activities, see 6.7.1 .\n",

Members may need short-term assistance at times of illness, births, deaths, job loss, and other circumstances. When needed, ministering sisters ask the Relief Society presidency for help. The presidency may recommend calling a service coordinator to organize these efforts (see 9.3.4 ). The Relief Society and elders quorum coordinate efforts to address short-term needs (see 22.3.2 ). The bishop may provide fast-offering assistance if needed. In some locations, bishops have the option to provide members in need with a bishop’s order for food and other basic goods. The bishop generally assigns the Relief Society president to meet with the members and fill out the order form. However, he may also assign the elders quorum president. A counselor in the Relief Society or elders quorum presidency may be assigned if the president is unavailable. The assigned leader submits the completed form to the bishop for his approval. For more information, see 22.6.2 and “ Welfare Resources ” in Leader and Clerk Resources. 9.2.2.3 Long-Term Needs and Self-Reliance As coordinated by the bishop, the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies help members with long-term needs and self-reliance. They teach principles of temporal and spiritual self-reliance. See chapter 22 and “ Self-Reliance ” in the Gospel Library app. If a person or family needs assistance, the Relief Society and elders quorum presidents counsel together, as coordinated by the bishop, about how to help (see 22.4 ). The Relief Society president, elders quorum president, or another leader helps the person or family develop a Self-Reliance Plan . Ministering sisters or brothers can also help with the plan. Often, other members of the Relief Society or elders quorum have skills or experience that can help. All who assist treat information with confidentiality. For more information, see 22.3.3 and 22.8 . 9.2.2.4 When a Ward Member Dies When a ward member dies, Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies offer comfort and assistance. Under the bishop’s guidance, they can help with the funeral. If possible, deceased members who were endowed are buried or cremated in temple clothing. The body of a woman may be dressed by her husband or by an endowed female family member. If a family member is not available or would prefer not to do the dressing, the bishop may ask the Relief Society president to invite an endowed sister to dress the body or oversee the dressing.

In presidency and Relief Society meetings, the Relief Society presidency discusses ways the sisters can invite all to receive the blessings of the gospel. See 23.1.1 , 23.1.2 , and 23.1.3 . The Relief Society president assigns a member of the presidency to help lead efforts to share the gospel in the ward. She works with the assigned member of the elders quorum presidency to coordinate these efforts (see 23.6.2 ). The assigned member of the Relief Society presidency participates in weekly coordination meetings to coordinate inviting all to receive the blessings of the gospel.

They help new and returning members, new members of Relief Society, and newly called missionaries find and prepare ancestors’ names for temple ordinances.

The bishopric and youth quorum leaders, with help from advisers, support parents in this responsibility as follows: <ul> <li> <p>Encourage communication between young men and their families.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure that youth activities support and bless families.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help parents prepare their sons for priesthood ordinations and to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help parents prepare their sons for the temple endowment, full-time missionary service, temple marriage, and fatherhood.</p> </li> </ul> Leaders should be sensitive to youth who lack family support for gospel living. Parents and leaders strive to be good examples to the youth. They mentor youth in their efforts to become more like Jesus Christ. The Children and Youth program can help in these efforts (see ChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). 10.2.1.2 Gospel Learning The bishopric, youth quorum leaders, and advisers encourage young men and their families to learn the gospel at home. Leaders and advisers study the gospel and share with the young men what they learn. They invite quorum members to share at church what they are learning at home. Aaronic Priesthood quorums meet on Sundays to strengthen faith, build unity, strengthen families and homes, and make plans to participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation. The bishopric and youth quorum leaders, supported by advisers, plan Sunday meetings. Image young men studying Quorum meetings are held on the second and fourth Sundays of the month. They last 50 minutes. Meetings begin with a prayer. A member of the quorum presidency (or one of the bishop’s assistants in the priests quorum) conducts. He leads the quorum in reciting the theme and counseling together about assignments, duties, and other matters. A quorum member or adult leader then leads gospel instruction. Quorum leaders counsel with advisers about who should teach. Meeting outlines are found in Come, Follow Me . Meetings should end with a prayer. Normally, each Aaronic Priesthood quorum meets separately (see 10.1.5 ). Young men and young women may occasionally combine for a Sunday lesson, as coordinated by the bishopric and the Young Women presidency. Young men are encouraged to participate in seminary (see 15.1 ). 10.2.1.3 Service and Activities The bishopric and youth quorum leaders, supported by advisers, plan service and activities. These should help accomplish God’s work of salvation and exaltation. Service and activities should build testimonies, strengthen families, foster quorum unity, and provide opportunities to bless others. They should be balanced among four areas of personal growth: spiritual, social, physical, and intellectual. Most youth activities are held at times other than on Sundays or Monday evenings. They are usually held weekly. In some areas, distance, safety, or other factors make weekly activities impractical. In these areas, activities may be held less often, but they should generally be held at least monthly. Activities can be planned on the Sample Service and Activity Planner , available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Some service and activities should include both young men and young women, especially for older youth. Youth can benefit from socializing in larger groups. The youth in two or more wards may occasionally meet together for service and activities. Stakes or districts may occasionally plan service and activities for youth (see 20.3.2 ). Adult leaders help ensure that activities are safe (see safety.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; see also 20.7 in this handbook). At least two responsible adult leaders should be present at all activities (see 10.8.1 ). For more information, see AaronicPriesthoodQuorums.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . See also JustServe.org where it is available. These resources provide service and activity ideas. Annual Activities. In addition to regular youth activities, young men may also participate in the following each year: <ul> <li> <p>A meeting for youth and their parents near the beginning of the year. It can be held for young men and young women separately or together. It can also be held at the ward or stake level.

Young men turning 12 during the year may receive their emblems of belonging during this meeting (see <a>10.8.3</a>). For more information, see <a>ChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>An Aaronic Priesthood quorum camp (see <cite><a>Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Camp Guide</a></cite>).

With their parents’ approval, young men may attend overnight Aaronic Priesthood camps beginning in January of the year they turn 12. They may attend dances, youth conferences, and FSY conferences beginning in January of the year they turn 14. Paying for Activities. Activities, including supplies, are paid for by the ward budget. Travel and expenses should not be excessive. As an exception, if the ward budget does not have enough money to pay for multiday activities, such as camps, leaders may ask participants to help pay for them. However, a young man should not be prevented from participating if he cannot help pay. If more money is still needed, the bishop may authorize one fundraising activity each year (see 20.6.5 ). The bishopric ensures that the budget and activities for young men and young women are sufficient and equitable. Budget for Aaronic Priesthood quorums is based on the number of young men in the ward. Budget for the young women is based on the number of young women in the ward. See FSY.ChurchofJesusChrist.org for information about funding for FSY conferences. Image young men outside 10.2.1.4 Personal Development In their efforts to become more like the Savior, youth are invited to set goals to grow spiritually, socially, physically, and intellectually (see Luke 2:52 ). Youth seek inspiration to discover what they need to work on. With help from parents, they make plans, act on their plans, and reflect on what they learn. Leaders and advisers also offer support as needed. However, they should not track the young men’s goals or progress. Parents and leaders may suggest goals, but they allow youth to seek their own inspiration about what goals to pursue. Youth are encouraged to complete at least two goals in each of the four areas each year. They can use Personal Development: Youth Guidebook or the Gospel Living app to set and record goals.

They should be balanced among four areas of personal growth: spiritual, social, physical, and intellectual. Most youth activities are held at times other than on Sundays or Monday evenings.

In these areas, activities may be held less often, but they should generally be held at least monthly. Activities can be planned on the Sample Service and Activity Planner , available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Some service and activities should include both young men and young women, especially for older youth. Youth can benefit from socializing in larger groups. The youth in two or more wards may occasionally meet together for service and activities. Stakes or districts may occasionally plan service and activities for youth (see 20.3.2 ). Adult leaders help ensure that activities are safe (see safety.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; see also 20.7 in this handbook).

The bishopric, Young Women leaders, and class presidencies support parents in this responsibility as follows: <ul> <li> <p>Encourage communication between young women and their families.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure that youth activities support and bless families.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help parents prepare their daughters for the temple endowment, full-time missionary service (if the young women desire), temple marriage, and motherhood.</p> </li> </ul> Leaders should be sensitive to youth who lack family support for gospel living. Parents and leaders strive to be good examples to the youth. They mentor youth in their efforts to become more like Jesus Christ. The Children and Youth program can help in these efforts (see ChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). 11.2.1.2 Gospel Learning Young Women leaders and class presidencies encourage young women and their families to learn the gospel at home. Leaders study the gospel and share with the young women what they learn. They invite class members to share at church what they are learning at home. Young Women classes meet on Sundays to strengthen faith, build unity, strengthen families and homes, and make plans to participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation. Class presidencies, supported by adult leaders, plan Sunday meetings. Class meetings are held on the second and fourth Sundays of the month. They last 50 minutes. Meetings begin with a prayer. A member of the class presidency conducts. She leads the class in reciting the theme and counseling together about assignments and other matters. A class member or adult leader then leads gospel instruction. Class presidencies counsel with adult leaders about who should teach. Meeting outlines are found in Come, Follow Me . Meetings should end with a prayer. If a ward has more than one Young Women class, they meet separately. However, they may meet together when there is a special need. Young women and young men may occasionally combine for a Sunday lesson, as coordinated by the bishopric and the Young Women presidency. Young women are encouraged to participate in seminary (see 15.1 ). 11.2.1.3 Service and Activities Class presidencies, supported by adult leaders, plan service and activities. These should help accomplish God’s work of salvation and exaltation. Service and activities should build testimonies, strengthen families, foster class unity, and provide opportunities to bless others. They should be balanced among four areas of personal growth: spiritual, social, physical, and intellectual. Most youth activities are held at times other than on Sundays or Monday evenings. They are usually held weekly. In some areas, distance, safety, or other factors make weekly activities impractical. In these areas, activities may be held less often, but they should generally be held at least monthly. Activities can be planned on the Sample Service and Activity Planner , available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Some service and activities should include both young men and young women, especially for older youth. Youth can benefit from socializing in larger groups. The youth in two or more wards may occasionally meet together for service and activities. Stakes or districts may occasionally plan service and activities for youth (see 20.3.2 ). Adult leaders help ensure that activities are safe (see safety.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; see also 20.7 in this handbook). At least two responsible adult leaders should be present at all activities (see 11.6.1 ). For more information, see YoungWomen.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . See also JustServe.org where it is available. These resources provide service and activity ideas. Annual Activities. In addition to regular youth activities, young women may also participate in the following each year: <ul> <li> <p>A meeting for youth and their parents near the beginning of the year. It can be held for young men and young women separately or together. It can also be held at the ward or stake level. It is planned and led by the assistants to the bishop in the priests quorum and the presidency of the oldest Young Women class. Young women turning 12 during the year may receive their emblems of belonging during this meeting (see <a>11.6.3</a>). For more information, see <a>ChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Young Women camp (see <cite><a>Young Women Camp Guide</a></cite>).

With their parents’ approval, young women may attend overnight Young Women camps beginning in January of the year they turn 12. They may attend dances, youth conferences, and FSY conferences beginning in January of the year they turn 14. Paying for Activities. Activities, including supplies, are paid for by the ward budget. Travel and expenses should not be excessive. As an exception, if the ward budget does not have enough money to pay for multiday activities, such as camps, leaders may ask participants to help pay for them. However, a young woman should not be prevented from participating if she cannot help pay. If more money is still needed, the bishop may authorize one fundraising activity each year (see 20.6.5 ). The bishopric ensures that the budget and activities for young women and young men are sufficient and equitable. Budget for the young women is based on the number of young women in the ward. Budget for Aaronic Priesthood quorums is based on the number of young men in the ward. Image young women having a water fight See FSY.ChurchofJesusChrist.org for information about funding for FSY conferences. 11.2.1.4 Personal Development In their efforts to become more like the Savior, youth are invited to set goals to grow spiritually, socially, physically, and intellectually (see Luke 2:52 ). Youth seek inspiration to discover what they need to work on. With help from parents, they make plans, act on their plans, and reflect on what they learn. Leaders also offer support as needed. However, they should not track the young women’s goals or progress. Parents and leaders may suggest goals, but they allow youth to seek their own inspiration about what goals to pursue. Youth are encouraged to complete at least two goals in each of the four areas each year. They can use Personal Development: Youth Guidebook or the Gospel Living app to set and record goals.

This includes teaching them about the blessings and expectations of full-time missionary work. As part of this preparation, the bishopric or stake presidency may organize a missionary preparation class. The main resources for this class are the scriptures, Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ , and Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ . This class is not held during regular Sunday meetings. Missionary.ChurchofJesusChrist.org provides additional resources that can help young women who desire to prepare to serve a mission.

      "12.3.2 Image icon, guidelines for adaptation Primary Presidency The bishop calls and sets apart an adult woman to serve as the ward Primary president. If the unit is large enough, she recommends one or two adult women to be called as her counselors (see chapter 30 ). The bishopric considers her recommendations and extends the callings. The Primary presidency receives orientation and ongoing support from the stake Primary presidency. In a small unit, the Primary president may be the only called leader in Primary. In this case, she works with parents to organize lessons, singing time, and activities. She also ensures that at least two responsible adults are present at all meetings and activities. If the unit is large enough, additional callings might be filled in this order: counselors, music leader, teachers and nursery leaders, secretary, and activity leaders. If a branch does not have a Primary president, the Relief Society president may help parents organize instruction for children until a Primary president is called. The Primary presidency helps parents prepare children to enter and progress along the covenant path. This is one of their most important responsibilities. To accomplish this, the Primary president may assign a member of the presidency to help parents prepare their children to be baptized and confirmed. The Primary president may assign another presidency member to help parents with temple and priesthood preparation for their children. These presidency members make parents aware of resources in the Gospel Library that can help. See, for example, “ Preparing Your Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path ” in Come, Follow Me . Presidency members may work with ministering brothers and sisters, teachers, and others to support parents. The Primary president has the following additional responsibilities. Her counselors assist her. <ul> <li> <p>Serve on the ward council.

By following these invitations, Primary leaders love and teach children in the Savior’s way. The Primary presidency recommends to the bishopric men and women to serve as Primary teachers and nursery leaders. The bishopric considers these recommendations and extends the callings. These members are called to teach and minister to specific age-groups of children. Primary teachers teach from Come, Follow Me (ages 3–11). On fifth Sundays, they are encouraged to teach lessons from “ Appendix B: For Primary—Preparing Your Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path .” Nursery leaders teach from Behold Your Little Ones . Teachers and nursery leaders follow the principles in Teaching in the Savior’s Way and chapter 17 of this handbook. When adults teach children in Church settings, at least two responsible adults should be present. The two adults could be two women, two men, or a married couple. If this is not possible, leaders should combine classes. Leaders and teachers must complete the training at ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . (See 12.5.1 .) Youth should not teach in Primary, including as substitutes. Primary teachers and nursery leaders stay with the children throughout Primary, including singing time and transitions. During singing time, teachers participate with their classes. Teachers should remain with young children after Primary until a family member comes for them.

      "14.1.1 Stake Leadership 14.1.1.1 Stake Presidency The involvement of the stake presidency is particularly important in engaging single members in God’s work of salvation and exaltation. The stake president may assign one of his counselors and a high councilor to support single adults. He may also assign a counselor and a high councilor to support young single adults. He may also ask the stake Relief Society president to assign a presidency member to support single adults and young single adults. The same leaders could be assigned to both groups. The stake presidency pays particular attention to young single adults—as they do all members of the rising generation. The stake presidency determines whether activities for young single adults should take place at the ward level, the stake level, or some combination of both. Activities for single adults take place at the stake and multistake level. (See chapter 20 .) When the number of single members in a location is sufficient, stake presidents may recommend organizing a young single adult ward or a single adult ward (see 14.3 ). A stake (or a group of adjacent stakes) may not have enough single members to create a young single adult or single adult ward. In this situation, the Area Presidency may authorize a stake president to invite all of these members to be members of a designated geographic ward. This allows single adults or young single adults to serve and worship together. The Area Presidency counsels with their assigned member of the Presidency of the Seventy and the Quorum of the Twelve. 14.1.1.2 Stake Young Single Adult and Single Adult Committees Single members serve God’s children by participating in His work of salvation and exaltation (see 1.2 and 14.2 ). To help them do so, the stake presidency creates a young single adult committee. This committee is made up of the young single adult leaders from each ward. A young single adult man and young single adult woman are called to lead the committee. They serve on the stake council. If there are not enough young single adults to form a committee in a stake, a group of neighboring stakes may create a committee with the approval of the Area Presidency. The stake presidency may also create a single adult committee. It is made up of a few single adults from each ward. A single adult man and single adult woman are called to lead the committee. They serve on the stake council. If there are not enough single adults to form a committee in a stake, a group of neighboring stakes may create a committee with the approval of the Area Presidency. Committees seek to support members through friendship and opportunities to participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation (see 14.2 ). They plan opportunities for gospel learning and for service and activities. The committees meet as needed. The assigned member of the stake presidency and stake Relief Society presidency and the assigned high councilor may attend these meetings to provide support. Young single adult committees coordinate with campus institute programs, where available. Normally the single adult and young single adult committees function separately from one another.\n",

They work with the ward council to identify meaningful callings and assignments for single members. They recognize and strive to help meet the needs of single parents. Generally, the bishopric supports single members as they support all members of the elders quorum and Relief Society.

If there is a ward young single adult committee, the leaders of this committee are invited to attend and report on their efforts. These presidency members support the ward young single adult committee if one is organized (see 14.1.2.4 ). 14.1.2.3 Young Single Adult Leaders In a ward with many young single adults, the bishopric may call a young single adult man and woman as young single adult leaders.

The stake president may assign one of his counselors and a high councilor to support single adults. He may also assign a counselor and a high councilor to support young single adults. He may also ask the stake Relief Society president to assign a presidency member to support single adults and young single adults. The same leaders could be assigned to both groups. The stake presidency pays particular attention to young single adults—as they do all members of the rising generation. The stake presidency determines whether activities for young single adults should take place at the ward level, the stake level, or some combination of both. Activities for single adults take place at the stake and multistake level. (See chapter 20 .) When the number of single members in a location is sufficient, stake presidents may recommend organizing a young single adult ward or a single adult ward (see 14.3 ). A stake (or a group of adjacent stakes) may not have enough single members to create a young single adult or single adult ward. In this situation, the Area Presidency may authorize a stake president to invite all of these members to be members of a designated geographic ward. This allows single adults or young single adults to serve and worship together. The Area Presidency counsels with their assigned member of the Presidency of the Seventy and the Quorum of the Twelve.\n",

Sacrament tablecloths should be white, clean, and pressed. Sacrament trays should be clean. Sacrament trays and cups should be ordered well in advance. Sacrament supplies may be ordered at store.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Those who administer the sacrament should do so in a dignified manner, realizing that they are representing the Lord. The bishopric encourages them to ponder the Savior’s Atonement as they prepare, bless, and pass the sacrament. Those who administer the sacrament should be well groomed and clean. They should not wear clothing or jewelry that might detract from the worship and covenant making that are the purpose of the sacrament. If the bishop needs to counsel a priesthood holder about such matters, he does so with love. He also takes into account the person’s maturity in the Church. The passing of the sacrament should be natural and not overly formal. For example, certain actions (such as holding the left hand behind the back) or appearances (such as dressing alike) should not be required. The congregation sings a sacrament hymn while the bread is being broken. Vocal solos or instrumental music should not replace this hymn. No music should be played during the passing of the sacrament or immediately after. If members have food allergies or gluten intolerance, they discuss with a member of the bishopric what adaptations to make for the sacrament. As needed, the bishopric may modify the procedure for administering the sacrament to them. Generally, bread must be broken as part of the sacrament ordinance. However, to ensure the health and safety of a particular member, that member may provide allergen-free bread or another broken bread-like substitute in a sealed plastic bag or cup. They give this to a priesthood holder to place on a separate tray. The bishopric helps those who pass the sacrament know which members to whom the allergen-free item should be passed. See disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org for guidelines about food allergies. Although the sacrament is for members of the Church, nothing should be done to prevent others from partaking of it.\n",

However, the bishop usually provides recommendations for these ordinations. 18.10.1.1 Elders Worthy brethren may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained elders when they are 18 years old or older. Based on individual circumstances, the bishop determines whether a young man should be recommended to be ordained an elder soon after his 18th birthday or remain with the priests quorum longer. These circumstances include a young man’s: <ul> <li> <p>Testimony and maturity.</p> </li> <li> <p>School graduation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Desire to continue with peers.</p> </li> <li> <p>College attendance.</p> </li> </ul> In making this decision, the bishop consults first with the young man and his parents or guardians. Worthy men should be ordained elders by age 19 or before they leave home to attend college, serve a full-time mission, serve in the military, or accept full-time employment. Recently baptized men ages 18 and older are ordained elders after they have: <ul> <li> <p>Received the Aaronic Priesthood and served as priests.</p> </li> <li> <p>Developed sufficient understanding of the gospel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Demonstrated their worthiness.</p> </li> </ul> No specific time as a Church member is required. 18.10.1.2 High Priests Men are ordained high priests when they are called to a stake presidency, high council, or bishopric. They may also be ordained at other times as determined by the stake president through prayerful consideration and inspiration. 18.10.1.3 Interviewing and Sustaining With the approval of the stake presidency, the bishop interviews the brother as instructed on the Melchizedek Priesthood Ordination Record. Then a member of the stake presidency also interviews him. With approval from the mission president, the district president may interview a brother to be ordained an elder (see 6.3 ). For instructions about these interviews, see 31.2.6 . After the interview, the stake presidency asks the high council to sustain the decision to ordain the brother. A member of the stake presidency presents him for sustaining in the general session of stake conference (see 18.10.3 ).

The bishop interviews brethren who are to be ordained priests. Before interviewing a young man for priesthood ordination, the bishop obtains verbal permission from the parents or guardians. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the action. If the brother is found worthy in an interview, a member of the bishopric presents him for sustaining in sacrament meeting (see 18.10.3 ).

Brethren to be ordained elders or high priests are presented by a stake presidency member in the general session of stake conference (see 6.3 for instructions for district presidents). Brethren to be ordained deacons, teachers, or priests are presented by a bishopric member in sacrament meeting. The person who conducts the sustaining asks the brother to stand. He announces the proposal to confer the Aaronic or Melchizedek Priesthood (if needed) and to ordain the brother to the priesthood office. He then invites the members to sustain the proposal. For example, to present a brother to be ordained an elder, he could use words like these: “We propose that [name] receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained an elder. Those in favor may show it by the uplifted hand. [Pause briefly.] Those opposed, if any, may also show it. [Pause briefly.]” The person who is being presented should participate in the sustaining. If more than one person is being presented, they may be sustained as a group. If a member in good standing opposes the ordination, the presiding leader or another assigned priesthood leader meets with him or her in private after the meeting. The leader seeks to understand why the member is opposed. He learns if the member knows of conduct that could disqualify the person from being ordained to the priesthood office. Only members in good standing may participate in the sustaining. However, if a member not in good standing or a person who is not a member opposes the action, the bishop or stake president may hear his or her concern in private outside of the meeting. In some cases, a brother may need to be ordained an elder or high priest before he can be presented in stake conference. When this happens, he is presented in his ward sacrament meeting for sustaining. He is then presented in the next stake conference to ratify the ordination (adapting the process for sustaining, described above). This includes giving stake members an opportunity to sustain or oppose the action.\n",

The stake president or a high priest under his direction may ordain a man to the office of high priest. Only high priests may stand in the circle.

A bishop may allow a father who is a priest or a Melchizedek Priesthood holder to ordain his son to the office of deacon, teacher, or priest even if the father is not fully temple worthy (see 18.3 ).

They gather to build faith and testimony and to worship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Music should be selected to help achieve these purposes. Music in sacrament meeting includes congregational singing of hymns to open and close the meeting and before the administration of the sacrament. Congregational hymns provide an opportunity for members to unite as they actively participate in worshipping together. The sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior. For more information, see “ Hymns for Congregations ,” Hymns , 380–81. Prelude music is played as members gather before the meeting. Its purpose is to create an atmosphere of worship that invites the Spirit. After the closing prayer, an instrumental postlude is played as members leave the meeting. Hymns and other sacred music can be selected for prelude and postlude music. A sacrament meeting could also include an additional congregational hymn sung in the middle of the meeting—for example, between spoken messages. Or it may include one or more other musical selections. These could be presented by choirs (see 19.3.7 ), vocal or instrumental soloists, or small groups. Sacrament meetings should not be turned over to outside musical groups. The piano, organ, or another instrument approved by the bishopric may be used to accompany hymn singing in sacrament meeting (see 19.3.6 ). Music coordinators and bishoprics try to find a balance between familiar and less-familiar hymns. Musical selections presented by the ward choir or others can help members become more familiar with hymns that are not as well known.\n",

Such insurance may be available through homeowners insurance or other policies. For more information, see “ FAQs—What Should I Do? ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 20.7.3.4 Church Activity Medical Assistance Program In the United States and Canada, the Church Activity Medical Assistance (CAMA) program provides secondary medical and dental assistance for injuries sustained while participating in a Church activity. It also provides funeral assistance if necessary. This program is designed to supplement, not replace, a person’s own health and accident insurance. For more information, see “ FAQs—What Should I Do? ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . If an incident occurs during a Church-sponsored event, leaders determine if CAMA might be needed. Any leader may report an incident in the Global Incident Reporting system at incidents.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . If the leader indicates that treatment beyond first aid is expected, the bishop will be notified and will receive enrollment information. The bishop considers a person’s ability to pay medical expenses by other means, such as personal insurance coverage or other resources. He may authorize the use of CAMA funds if he feels it is appropriate. For more information, see the Church Activity Medical Assistance Handbook .

Participants should not travel long distances (more than a few hours) for activities. Any exceptions require approval from the Area Presidency. If the Area Presidency approves such travel, members should not provide it at their own expense (see 20.6 ). Travel practices and the application of guidelines in this section should be consistent among units in the same area or coordinating council. Stake presidents may discuss and agree on travel practices during coordinating council meetings. Leaders fill out an Event and Activity Plan form for activities that involve long-distance travel. When a Church activity for youth involves long-distance travel or staying overnight, parents or guardians must give written permission for their children to participate (see 20.7.4 ). Responsible adult supervision must be provided (see 20.7.1 ). When feasible, Church groups should use commercial transportation for long-distance travel. It should be licensed and protected by liability insurance. When Church groups travel in private passenger vehicles, each vehicle must be in safe operating condition. Each person should use a seat belt. Each driver should be a licensed, responsible adult. All vehicles and drivers should be covered with reasonable amounts of automobile liability insurance. Plans should be made to ensure that drivers remain aware and alert. Whenever possible, an adult should not be alone with a youth in a vehicle unless the youth is his or her child. Church organizations may not own or acquire automobiles or buses for group travel. A man and a woman should not travel alone together for Church activities, meetings, or assignments unless they are married to each other or are both single.

They take into account the strengths and needs of the members. They also consider the needs of children in the family. They normally assign two brothers or two sisters as companionships. They seek the bishop’s approval for ministering companionships and assignments. When making these decisions, leaders consider the following: <ul> <li> <p>Dedicated ministering brothers and sisters should be assigned to members who have the greatest need. These may include new members, single parents, widows, widowers, and less-active members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Youth may serve as companions to adults according to the guidelines in <a>21.2.2</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A married couple may be assigned to minister together to a person or family.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stake presidencies and bishoprics care for all members of the stake or ward.

      "21.2.2 Ministering Assignments for Youth Even before they receive ministering assignments, youth minister to others by serving them in Christlike ways. A youth’s service as a ministering sister or brother can be a significant part of helping accomplish God’s work of salvation and exaltation. A young woman may serve as a ministering companion to a Relief Society sister when the young woman is willing and able. She may begin serving in the year she turns 14. The Relief Society presidency counsels with the young woman, her parents, and the Young Women presidency as they consider ministering assignments. It is often a blessing to a sister to have a young woman minister to her. It can also be a blessing to the young woman. A young man serves as a ministering companion to a Melchizedek Priesthood holder when he is ordained to the office of teacher or priest. The bishop determines whether the young man is worthy and prepared to be ordained. (See 10.1.3.2 .) The elders quorum presidency counsels with the young man, his parents, and the bishopric as they consider ministering assignments. In some cases, youth may be assigned as a third member of a ministering companionship. Leaders may assign the youth to help minister to some or all of the individuals and families assigned to the companionship. Youth do not have ministering brothers or sisters assigned to them. They receive ministering care from their family’s ministering brothers. Their class or quorum presidency and adult leaders also minister to them. If their parents are not members of the Church but are open to receiving ministering, the elders quorum presidency may assign ministering brothers to the family. Similarly, the Relief Society presidency may assign ministering sisters to the mother. The Church’s guideline that two responsible adults be present with youth does not apply to ministering companions. However, leaders use wisdom and seek inspiration when assigning youth as companions to adults. They also seek guidance from the bishop. When a youth is assigned to a companion who is not his or her parent, leaders confirm that the parents do not object to the assignment. Adult companions should avoid situations that might be misunderstood. They use care in one-on-one situations. They help youth have a safe and rewarding experience with ministering.

      "22.5.1 Policies Regarding Recipients of Church Assistance 22.5.1.1 Assistance to Ward Members Generally, members who receive Church assistance should live in the ward boundaries and have their membership record in the ward. Assistance can be given regardless of whether the member regularly attends Church meetings or follows Church standards. If a member recently moved into the ward, the bishop contacts the previous bishop to discuss the person’s situation before providing assistance. Bishops can also review any assistance given during the previous three years in the “ Finance ” section of LCR . 22.5.1.2 Assistance to Bishops and Stake Presidents At times a bishop or members of his immediate or extended family who live in the ward may need Church assistance. When this occurs, the bishop reviews the needs and the proposed assistance with the stake president. The stake president’s written approval is required before a bishop may use fast offerings or approve a bishop’s order for himself or his family. If fast-offering funds are used, the stake president reviews the bills and other expenses before authorizing payment. The bishop may not approve a payment for himself or his family. When a stake president or members of his immediate or extended family who live in his ward need assistance, he contacts the bishop. The bishop follows the same principles and guidelines of Church assistance that he would for any other member. However, once the bishop has approved the request, the stake president must submit it to the Area Presidency. The stake president and bishop await written approval from a member of the Area Presidency before proceeding with the payment or order. (If a district president needs assistance, approval is sought from the mission president rather than the Area Presidency.) 22.5.1.3 Assistance to Persons Who Are Transient or Homeless Bishops may assist members and others who are transient or homeless. However, they carefully consider the type and amount of assistance given. They are encouraged to counsel with the bishop of the person’s previous ward before giving assistance. Bishops generally invite transient or homeless members who receive assistance to accept work or service opportunities. Bishops may also refer these members to community resources that are equipped to address their needs. Based on need, a stake president may appoint one bishop to handle all requests arising in the stake from people who are transient or homeless. In some areas there is a concentration of stakes with large numbers of people who are transient or homeless. In those situations, the Area Presidency may call an area welfare and self-reliance specialist to handle their requests for assistance. This person should have served as a bishop. 22.5.1.4 Assistance to Persons Who Are Not Members of the Church Persons who are not members of the Church are usually referred to local community resources for assistance. On rare occasions, as guided by the Spirit, the bishop may assist them with fast offerings or bishops’ orders. For instance, the bishop may consider assistance for parents or caretakers who are not Church members but have one or more children who are members.\n",

      "22.5.2 Policies on Using Fast Offerings 22.5.2.1 Medical or Other Health Care Each Church area has established approval limits for using fast offerings to pay medical, dental, or mental health expenses. Limits may vary by region or country in an area. When bishops use fast offerings to help pay for medical, dental, or mental health care, they should not exceed these limits without appropriate approval. For approval amounts and guidelines, see “ Use of Fast Offerings for Medical Expenses .” 22.5.2.2 Consumer Debt and Failed Businesses or Investments Fast offerings may not be used to pay consumer debt, such as credit cards or personal loans. Nor may fast offerings be used to pay money owed as a result of a failed business or investment. 22.5.2.3 Repayment of Fast Offerings Members do not repay fast-offering assistance they receive from the Church. 22.5.2.4 Ward Fast-Offering Expenditure Amounts Bishops are not required to limit fast-offering assistance for ward members to the amount of donations collected within the ward.\n",

      "Lenght: 447\n",
      "22.5.3 Policies on Making Payments If possible, payments should be made directly to the businesses that provide goods and services. Payments are not typically made to the person being assisted. Bishopric members and clerks follow the financial procedures outlined in 34.5.7 when: <ul> <li> <p>Preparing a check.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preparing an electronic disbursement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Withdrawing cash for a fast-offering payment.</p> </li> </ul>\n",

      "22.5.4 Policies on Payments That Would Benefit a Bishop or Stake President When providing members with fast-offering assistance, a bishop may not use the funds to pay for goods or services in a way that would benefit him personally. Any exception would require approval from the stake president. For example, if the bishop owns the rental property where a member lives, he may not use fast offerings to pay that member’s rent unless the stake president first gives approval. If a fast-offering payment for a member would benefit the stake president or a business he owns, Area Presidency approval is required. Once the bishop approves the proposed payment, the stake president submits the request to the Area Presidency. The stake president and bishop await written approval from a member of the Area Presidency before proceeding with the payment.\n",

The stake Relief Society presidency, high councilors, and other members of the stake council assist them. The stake president and his counselors have the following responsibilities: <ul> <li> <p>Teach the principles and blessings related to (1) caring for those who have temporal and emotional needs and (2) building self-reliance (see <a>22.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Teach the law of the fast and encourage members to give a generous fast offering (see <a>22.2.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Teach bishops how to properly provide Church assistance to those who have temporal needs (see <a>22.9.1.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure that elders quorum presidents and ward Relief Society presidents are taught about their roles in caring for those in need. High councilors and stake Relief Society presidencies help instruct these leaders (see <a>22.9.2</a> and <a>22.9.3</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct the stake’s efforts to prepare for and respond to emergencies (see <a>22.9.1.3</a>).</p> </li> </ul> The stake president also has the following responsibilities: <ul> <li> <p>Review fast-offering requests for medical expenses that exceed a bishop’s approval limit. The stake president may approve requests up to his approval limit. He submits requests that exceed his approval limit to the Area Presidency for consideration (see <a>22.5.2.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Review any requests for Church assistance for bishops (see <a>22.5.1.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Serve as the agent stake president for welfare and self-reliance operations if assigned (see <a>22.9.1.2</a>).</p> </li> </ul> The stake presidency may assign one or more high councilors to help oversee the efforts of caring for those with temporal needs in the stake (see 22.9.2 ). The stake presidency may also call stake welfare and self-reliance specialists to support these efforts (see 22.9.4 ). 22.9.1.1 Teach Bishops the Principles of Providing Church Assistance The stake president ensures that bishops are caring for those with temporal needs in their wards. He teaches bishops the principles and policies for providing Church assistance (see 22.4 and 22.5 ). In his interviews with bishops, the stake president reviews fast-offering payments from the ward’s monthly financial statement. He also discusses with each bishop the principles he is using to help members. He counsels with the bishop about any payments or patterns in the statement that may show a misunderstanding of correct principles. Principles and practices for providing Church assistance are also discussed in the stake bishops’ council (see 22.11 ). The stake president ensures that bishoprics and clerks review the training in the video “ Sacred Funds, Sacred Responsibilities ” at least once a year. 22.9.1.2 Serve as the Agent Stake President for Church Welfare and Self-Reliance Operations Where applicable, the Area Presidency assigns an agent stake president to each welfare and self-reliance operation in their area. Examples of these operations include: <ul> <li> <p>Bishops’ storehouses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Family Services offices.</p> </li> <li> <p><a>BYU–Pathway Worldwide</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deseret Industries stores.</p> </li> </ul> The assigned stake president helps find volunteers to support the needs of the operation.

Committee members include: <ul> <li> <p>The stake president or an assigned counselor.</p> </li> <li> <p>A high councilor.</p> </li> <li> <p>A member of the stake Relief Society presidency.</p> </li> <li> <p>The manager of the operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Welfare and self-reliance specialists as needed.</p> </li> </ul> 22.9.1.3 Respond to Emergencies The stake president oversees Church emergency response and communications within his stake. In disasters that cover more than one stake, the Area Presidency or an assigned Area Seventy may direct the response. Welfare and self-reliance managers support area and stake leaders in these efforts. Stake presidents may call welfare and self-reliance specialists to oversee an emergency operations center, manage communications, or handle safety concerns. If needed, the Area Presidency or an Area Seventy may also appoint such specialists at the area level or coordinating council level. Ministering brothers and sisters report the conditions and needs of members to quorum and Relief Society leaders. These leaders report to the bishop, who reports to the stake presidency. The stake presidency reports information to (1) the Area Presidency or an assigned Area Seventy and (2) the welfare and self-reliance manager. This report includes the status of members, missionaries, Church facilities, and the community. If Church members have been affected by a disaster, bishops may use fast offerings to help meet basic needs. The stake president approves public information that is released locally by the Church. He coordinates this with the stake communication director if one is called (see 6.2.1.7 ). He may serve as the Church spokesman to respond to questions from the media. He may also assign the stake communication director or another spokesperson to do this. In disasters that cover more than one stake, the Area Presidency or an assigned Area Seventy may manage public communications. Church leaders may make the resources of the Church available to civil authorities during an emergency. With approval from the Area Presidency, Church buildings (except temples) may be used as shelters, first-aid stations, or feeding locations. Such use of a Church building should be coordinated with the assigned facilities manager. If another charitable or community organization is permitted to use the building, a usage agreement should be signed. See “ Use of Church Buildings in a Disaster ” for more information.

With the help of their service mission leaders, each service missionary receives assignments that are tailored to his or her circumstances. Assignments are also based on service opportunities (see 24.7.1 ). These missionaries serve to the full extent of their capacity. Single men ages 18–25 may serve as service missionaries. They usually serve for 24 months. Single women ages 19–29 may serve as service missionaries. They usually serve for 18 months. Service missions for young missionaries are not yet available in all areas of the world. For a list of areas where service missions are available, see ChurchofJesusChrist.org/service-missionary . That website also provides more information on service missions. Where service missions are not available, young members may serve in the same capacity as senior service missionaries (see 24.2.4 ).\n",

Single women ages 40 and older may also be called as senior missionaries if they do not have children living at home. Single men ages 40 and older may not serve as senior missionaries. However, they may serve as senior service missionaries. (See 24.2.4 .) All senior missionaries are encouraged to find people to teach and help them prepare for baptism. Senior missionaries may also be assigned to support: <ul> <li> <p>Members and area and local leaders.</p> </li> <li> <p>Areas, Church departments, and Church facilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Charitable organizations.</p> </li> </ul> Senior missionaries usually serve away from home for 6–23 months. Those who serve outside their resident country usually serve for at least 18 months. Senior missionaries are not asked to work the same hours, perform all the same activities, or meet the same expectations as young missionaries. Still, their service is demanding. For this reason, they should be healthy enough to serve. They should also meet financial qualifications (see 24.3.4.2 ). Bishops, stake presidents, and other leaders prayerfully consider who could serve. Bishops or stake presidents may interview these members to determine their availability and invite them to prepare to serve. Assignments for senior missionaries are given by revelation to Apostles. Leaders may recommend specific types of assignments for senior missionaries. However, leaders should not make commitments about the assignment they will receive. Candidates may express a preference for an assignment but should be willing to accept any assignment. For more information, see SeniorMissionary.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .

      "24.2.4 Senior Service Missionaries In addition to callings in their home ward or stake, members may serve the Lord as senior service missionaries. These missionaries give valuable service in Church departments, facilities, and missions (see 24.7.1 ). They live at home. Men and women ages 26 and older may be called as senior service missionaries. In addition, young men ages 18–25 and young women ages 19–25 may serve in the same capacity as senior service missionaries if they live where service missions for young missionaries are not available. They may also serve if they are married or have already served as young teaching or service missionaries. Senior service missionaries are called by the stake president. They serve under his direction. The amount of time they serve each week depends on their capacity, service opportunities in their area, and direction from the Area Presidency. Senior service missionaries’ assignments are approved by the stake president. He counsels with the missionary and others and prayerfully seeks revelation about each assignment. He may review SeniorMissionary.ChurchofJesusChrist.org when determining assignments. For more information about senior service missionaries, see 24.7 .\n",

      "24.3.2 Meeting the Standards of Worthiness Prospective missionaries strive to be worthy of the companionship of the Spirit. This is needed for effective missionary service (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:13–14 ). Qualifying for the companionship of the Spirit includes being clean from sin (see Helaman 4:24 ; Doctrine and Covenants 38:42 ). 24.3.2.1 Repentance Repentance and forgiveness of sin are gifts available to all of God’s children. These gifts are made possible through the redeeming power of Jesus Christ. Repentance requires exercising faith in Christ, having real intent, and keeping the commandments. It includes confessing and forsaking sin. For serious sins, repentance requires confession to the bishop or stake president (see 32.3 and 32.4 in this handbook). A person who repents is forgiven and made clean through the Atonement and grace of Jesus Christ. The Lord remembers the sin no more. “How great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!” ( Doctrine and Covenants 18:13 ; see also Isaiah 43:25 ; Jacob 6:5 ; Alma 34:15–17 ; Helaman 5:10–11 ; Doctrine and Covenants 58:42–43 ; and 32.1 in this handbook.) Members who desire to serve a mission should turn to the Savior as they repent and prepare to serve. They may also seek the loving help of family members and local Church leaders. A missionary candidate must have repented of serious sin before the stake president may submit his or her recommendation (see 32.6–32.8 ; see also 24.4.4 ). The repentance process includes enough time for the person to show through righteous living that he or she has received the spirit of Christ unto the remission of sins. (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 ). The stake president counsels with the Area Presidency (or the Area Seventy they designate) if he has questions about the length of time needed for repentance. 24.3.2.2 Belated Confessions A person who receives a mission call or begins missionary service without repenting of serious sin may need to remain home or return home. Depending on the circumstances, he or she may serve after repenting (see 24.6.3.2 ).\n",

Health may be affected by a change in diet, climate, or living conditions. The missionary schedule is also demanding. (See Alma 17:5 ; 26:27–28, 30 .) Young teaching missionaries must be committed and physically, mentally, and emotionally able to work the full missionary schedule. (See Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ [2019], 2.4 .) Young service missionaries work a schedule customized to the full extent of their talents, skills, and capacities. Prospective missionaries prepare to serve by strengthening their physical, mental, and emotional health. They also work to develop resiliency and self-reliance. Leaders may need to counsel sensitively with a candidate about his or her health challenges before submitting a recommendation. Some candidates may need to receive professional care for their health challenges (see 31.3.6 ). A candidate who has been prescribed medication must commit to take it throughout his or her service as directed by a health care professional. Image missionaries teaching family\n",

      "24.3.4 Finances Financial sacrifice is part of missionary service (see Mark 1:17–18 ; Alma 15:16 ). Missionaries and their families have primary responsibility for contributing financially to missionary service. They should make appropriate preparation and sacrifice. They should be financially self-reliant to the extent possible in meeting contribution commitments. 24.3.4.1 Financing Young Missionaries Serving Away from Home Young candidates who have prepared according to their ability should not be delayed from serving for financial reasons. Those who need financial help to meet expected contribution commitments can receive it from extended family and friends. If need remains, the bishop or stake president may ask members in the ward or stake to contribute to the ward missionary fund. Local unit budgets and fast-offering funds may not be used. Monthly contribution commitment. Young teaching missionaries and their families contribute a specific amount each month to help cover missionary program costs. The amount is set in one of two ways: <ul> <li> <p>Missionaries from some countries participate in the equalized contribution program. This means the same amount is contributed for each missionary regardless of where he or she serves. The amount is identified at Church headquarters. Leaders may contact the Missionary Department (see <a>24.9.3</a>) or the area office for a list of countries in this program and the equalized amount.</p> </li> <li> <p>In other countries, the bishop, stake president, missionary, and family counsel together about the monthly contribution amount. The bishop and stake president consider guidance from the Area Presidency. They encourage appropriate financial sacrifice and self-reliance based on the circumstances of the missionary and his or her family. They agree on a contribution amount and record it in the missionary recommendation. The missionary and his or her family commit to follow through. Others may also contribute to this amount only if they live in the missionary’s home country (see “<a>Ward Missionary Fund</a>” later in this section).</p> </li> </ul> Contributions are made to the ward missionary fund. Bishops verify that the funds are contributed each month. Funds beyond the monthly amount should not be contributed in advance. Funds contributed in advance cannot be refunded if a missionary returns home early. Expenses in the field. Each month, young missionaries receive adequate funds from the mission to provide for healthy food, transportation, and other living expenses. These funds are sacred. Missionaries use them only for mission-related purposes. They should not be used for personal expenses, saved, or sent to family members or others. Missionaries return to the mission any funds they do not need. Missionaries use personal funds to cover other expenses. These personal expenses should be minimal. (See Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ , 4.8 .) Ward Missionary Fund The ward missionary fund is used only for donations relating to ward members who are serving missions away from home. These funds are not used for service missionaries or for missionary activities in the ward or stake. Funds are not sent directly to missionaries. Each month, the bishop sees that the committed funds are available in the ward missionary fund. The Church withdraws the contribution amount each month and uses it for missionary efforts worldwide. See 34.3.3 . Contributions are consecrated to the Lord to accomplish His work. They cannot be refunded.

The priesthood leader may explain basic gospel principles. He may also help members understand the temple recommend questions if needed. However, he should not present his personal beliefs, preferences, or interpretations as Church doctrine or policy. Temple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private. However, the person being interviewed may invite a spouse, parent, or another adult to be present. 26.3.3.1 Temple Recommend Interview Questions <ol> <li> <p>Do you have faith in and a testimony of God, the Eternal Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role as your Savior and Redeemer?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person on the earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?</p> <p>Do you sustain the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators?</p> <p>Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local leaders of the Church?</p> </li> <li> <p>The Lord has said that all things are to be “done in cleanliness” before Him (<a>Doctrine and Covenants 42:41</a>).</p> <p>Do you strive for moral cleanliness in your thoughts and behavior?</p> <p>Do you obey the law of chastity?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ in your private and public behavior with members of your family and others?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you support or promote any teachings, practices, or doctrine contrary to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you strive to keep the Sabbath day holy, both at home and at church; attend your meetings; prepare for and worthily partake of the sacrament; and live your life in harmony with the laws and commandments of the gospel?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you strive to be honest in all that you do?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are you a full-tithe payer?</p> <p>For new members seeking a recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations: Are you willing to obey the commandment to pay tithing?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?</p> </li> <li> <p><i>(This question is omitted when interviewing a child or youth.)</i> Do you have any financial or other obligations to a former spouse or to children?</p> <p>If yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?</p> </li> <li> <p><i>(This question is omitted when interviewing a member who is not endowed.)</i> Do you keep the covenants that you made in the temple?</p> </li> <li> <p><i>(This question is omitted when interviewing a member who is not endowed.)</i> Do you honor your sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances?

If the couple plans to be both married and sealed during the same ceremony, they must bring a valid marriage license to the temple. Couples being sealed after a civil marriage do not need to bring a marriage license to the temple. Instead, they provide the date and location of their civil marriage as part of the record verification process. 27.3.2.4 Escorts for the Bride and Groom An endowed sister may accompany the bride to assist her in the dressing room. An endowed brother may do the same for the groom. An escort must have a current temple recommend.

If a family member or acquaintance holds the sealing authority and is assigned to the temple where the couple will be sealed, they may invite him to perform the sealing. A sealer may also seek First Presidency approval to perform a sealing for his lineal descendants (children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren) in a temple other than the one to which he is assigned. He must receive a letter of authorization from the First Presidency for each such sealing. He presents the letter at the temple. Members are discouraged from asking General Authorities to perform their temple sealing. 27.3.2.6 Appropriate Clothing for a Temple Sealing Bride’s Dress. A bride’s dress worn in the temple should be white, modest in design and fabric, and free of elaborate ornamentation. It also should cover the temple garment. Sheer fabric should be lined. To be consistent with other dresses worn in the temple, a bride’s dress should have long sleeves or three-quarter sleeves. Dresses should not have a train unless it can be pinned up or removed for the sealing ceremony. The temple can provide a dress if needed or desired. Groom’s Clothing. The groom wears normal temple clothing during the sealing ceremony (see 38.5.1 and 38.5.2 ). He may wear formal clothing outside the temple for photographs after the ceremony. Guests’ Clothing. Those who attend a sealing ceremony should wear clothing similar to what they would wear to a sacrament meeting. They should avoid wearing clothing that is casual or that does not cover the temple garment. They should also avoid wearing clothing that is overly formal, like tuxedos. Members who come to a sealing directly from an endowment session may wear ceremonial temple clothing. The couple should share this information with guests well before the sealing. Flowers. The couple and their guests should not wear flowers during the sealing ceremony. Flowers may be worn outside the temple for photographs after the ceremony. The couple should share this information with guests well before the sealing. 27.3.2.7 Exchanging Rings after a Temple Sealing Exchanging rings is not part of the temple sealing ceremony. However, couples may exchange rings after the ceremony in the sealing room. Couples should not exchange rings at any other time or place in a temple or on temple grounds. Doing so can detract from the ceremony. Couples who are married and sealed in the same ceremony may exchange rings at a later time to accommodate family members who are unable to attend a temple sealing. The ring exchange should be consistent with the dignity of a temple sealing. The exchange should not replicate any part of the sealing ceremony. The couple should not exchange vows after being sealed in the temple.

      "29.2.1 Sacrament Meeting Purposes Remember Jesus Christ by partaking of the sacrament. In this ordinance, Church members renew their covenant to take upon themselves the Savior’s name, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments. Other purposes include worshipping, building faith and testimony, and conducting ward business. Participants All are invited to attend (see 3 Nephi 18:30–32 ; see also 38.1.1 in this handbook). Frequency Each Sunday. 29.2.1.1 Planning Sacrament Meeting The bishopric plans and conducts sacrament meeting. They ensure that the focus of the meeting is on the sacrament and building faith in Jesus Christ. Sacrament meeting lasts one hour. It can include the following: <ol> <li> <p><i>Prelude music</i> (see <a>19.3.2</a> for guidelines). Reverent music before the meeting starts can invite a spirit of worship.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Greeting and welcome.</i></p> </li> <li> <p><i>Acknowledgment of presiding authorities or other leaders who are visiting.</i> Presiding authorities and visiting high councilors should be invited to sit on the stand. General Officers are also invited to sit on the stand unless they are attending their home ward.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Announcements.</i> These should be kept to a minimum. Most can be printed, shared electronically, or shared in other meetings.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Opening hymn and prayer.</i> See <a>19.3.2</a> and <a>29.6</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Ward and stake business,</i> such as the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sustaining and releasing officers and teachers (see <a>30.3</a> and <a>30.6</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Presenting names of brethren to be ordained to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood (see <a>18.10.3</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Recognizing new ward members, including recent converts. After a few words of introduction, the person conducting asks the congregation to show by an uplifted hand that they welcome the member into the ward.</p> <p>When children who are members of record are baptized and confirmed, they are recognized in sacrament meeting. However, they do not need to be presented for welcome into the ward.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><i>Naming and blessing children</i> (see <a>18.6</a>). This is usually done in fast and testimony meeting (see <a>29.2.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Confirming new converts</i> (see <a>18.8</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Sacrament hymn and administration of the sacrament.</i> The sacrament is the main focus of the meeting. Other parts of the meeting should not detract from it. This ordinance is an opportunity for members to direct their thoughts toward the Savior and His sacrifice for them. It should be a sacred time of spiritual renewal.</p> <p>The sacrament table should be prepared before the meeting begins. The bishop ensures that the sacrament is blessed and passed in a reverent and orderly way. Those who administer the sacrament represent Jesus Christ.</p> <p>For more about preparing, blessing, and passing the sacrament, see <a>18.9</a>.</p> <p>For information about administering the sacrament in unusual situations, see <a>29.2.1.5</a> and <a>18.9.1</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Gospel messages and congregational singing or other music.</i> Messages and music should be consistent with the sacred nature of the sacrament. For information about selecting speakers, see <a>29.2.1.4</a>. For information about musical selections in sacrament meeting, see <a>19.3.2</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Closing hymn and prayer.</i></p> </li> <li> <p><i>Postlude music.</i></p> </li> </ol> Visual aids and audiovisual materials should not be used in sacrament meetings (see 38.8.3 ). 29.2.1.2 Presiding at Sacrament Meeting The bishop presides at sacrament meeting unless a member of the stake presidency, an Area Seventy in his area, or a General Authority attends. If the bishop and his counselors are not able to attend sacrament meeting, the stake president designates who presides. Normally he designates the elders quorum president. However, he could invite another Melchizedek Priesthood holder. 29.2.1.3 Time before the Meeting Before the meeting starts, members of the congregation prepare spiritually for the sacrament. They can do this through quiet prayer and pondering. Leaders set an example of reverence. A member of the bishopric invites Young Women class presidencies to organize youth to minister by welcoming visitors and members as they enter the chapel. Youth make an effort to greet members by name. They also promote reverence by answering questions and helping people find seats as needed. 29.2.1.4 Selecting Speakers The bishopric selects speakers for sacrament meeting. Most often they invite ward members, including youth and children (see 38.8.18 ). The stake president may assign high councilors or members of stake organization presidencies to speak. The stake president determines the frequency of such assignments. The bishopric extends invitations to speak well in advance of the meeting. Speakers bear testimony of Jesus Christ and teach His gospel using the scriptures (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:12 ; 52:9 ). Messages should build faith and be consistent with the sacred nature of the sacrament. For information about newly called or recently returned missionaries speaking in sacrament meeting, see 24.5.2 and 24.8.3 . The bishopric schedules one sacrament meeting each year for a presentation by the Primary children. For information about this presentation, see 12.1.6 . Image man speaking over the pulpit 29.2.1.5 Image icon, guidelines for adaptation Sacrament Services in Unusual Situations Every member needs the spiritual blessings that come from partaking of the sacrament. However, some members are unable to attend sacrament meeting because they are confined to their home, a hospital, or a care facility. The bishop may assign priesthood holders to administer the sacrament to these members (see 18.9.1 ). In some cases, the bishop may authorize streaming sacrament meeting for those who cannot attend. For information, see 29.7 . When members are traveling or temporarily living away from home, they should attend sacrament meeting in a nearby ward if possible. Sacrament services should not be held in conjunction with family reunions, vacations, or other activities that are not sponsored by the Church.\n",

      "29.2.2 Fast and Testimony Meeting Purpose Partake of the sacrament and strengthen one another by bearing testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Members are encouraged to come to the meeting fasting if they are able to fast. Participants All are invited to attend. Frequency Once a month, sacrament meeting is a fast and testimony meeting. Usually this is on the first Sunday of the month. It may be on a different Sunday to accommodate general conference or stake conference. (See also 20.5.4 .) In a fast and testimony meeting, there are no assigned speakers or special musical selections. Instead, the person conducting bears a brief testimony. He then invites members of the congregation to bear their testimonies. To bear testimony means to declare gospel truths as inspired by the Holy Ghost. Testimonies should be brief so that many people can participate. Young children are welcome to bear testimony in fast and testimony meeting. It may be best for them to learn to do so at home until they can bear testimony without help from others. Under the bishop’s direction, children are usually named and blessed during fast and testimony meeting (see 29.2.1.1 ).\n",

      "29.2.3 Ward Conference Purpose At ward conference, stake leaders instruct, support, and minister to ward leaders and members. Ward members sustain general and local leaders. Participants All are invited to attend. Participants from the stake are determined by the stake presidency. Frequency Once a year on a Sunday other than fast Sunday. Ward conference is planned to meet local needs. It includes a sacrament meeting planned by the stake president. The stake president usually presides at the meeting, and a member of the bishopric usually conducts. During this meeting, a member of the stake presidency or high council presents the names of general, stake, and ward leaders for sustaining. He uses the Officers Sustained form , prepared by the ward clerk. The bishop and stake president usually speak in the meeting. The ward holds regular priesthood and organization meetings as part of ward conference. Stake leaders may give instruction and assistance. They minister to ward leaders and members. In connection with ward conference, the stake presidency meets with the bishopric. Together they review the progress of God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward. This meeting may be held on ward conference Sunday or at another time.\n",

      "29.2.4 Bishopric Meeting Purpose Counsel together and make decisions about matters concerning the ward. Give special attention to the bishopric’s responsibility for Aaronic Priesthood holders and young women. Participants The bishopric, ward clerk, and executive secretary. The bishop may invite others to attend as needed, such as the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents. Frequency Usually weekly. The bishop plans and conducts bishopric meetings. Matters for consideration could include: <ul> <li> <p>Coordinating God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strengthening individuals and families in the ward—especially youth and children.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identifying members who could prepare to receive ordinances, including priesthood ordinations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identifying members to call to ward positions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identifying members who could be recommended to the stake president to serve as missionaries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reviewing instructions from the scriptures, Church leaders, and this handbook.</p> </li> </ul> Other items may include ward organizations and programs, the ward budget, reports on assignments, and plans for upcoming meetings and activities.

      "29.2.5 Ward Council Meeting Purpose Help accomplish God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward (see 1.2 ). Participants <ul> <li> <p>The bishopric, ward clerk, and ward executive secretary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Presidents of the elders quorum, Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, and Sunday School.</p> </li> </ul> The bishop may invite others to attend, such as the ward mission leader, the ward temple and family history leader, the leaders of the ward young single adult committee, the ward music coordinator, and the full-time missionaries. Frequency Usually weekly (but may meet less often). The bishop plans, presides over, and conducts ward council meetings. If he is absent, he may assign a counselor to preside and conduct. However, the council does not make major decisions without the bishop. The ward council seeks to help all ward members build spiritual strength, receive saving ordinances, keep covenants, and become consecrated followers of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 6:4–5 ). During ward council meetings, council members plan and coordinate this work. They determine together how the strengths and abilities of ward members can bless those in need. They seek the guidance of the Spirit as they unite in love and concern for members of the ward. Ward organization leaders attend ward council meetings in two capacities: <ol> <li> <p>As members of the ward council who help bless all ward members.</p> </li> <li> <p>As representatives of their organizations.</p> </li> </ol> When they meet together, ward council members discuss matters that would benefit from unified efforts of the entire council. Each council member is encouraged to share his or her thoughts and inspiration on these matters. Ward council meetings usually do not last longer than one hour. They begin with a prayer and brief reports on assignments from previous meetings. Listed below are items that could be discussed. There is not enough time to discuss all of them in every meeting. The bishop gives priority to matters that are most needed to bless individuals and families. <ul> <li> <p><i>Living the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i> Helping all members build faith, receive saving ordinances, and keep their covenants.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Caring for those in need.</i> Sharing resources and skills to bless individuals, families, and the community. Helping ward members become self-reliant. (See <a>chapter 22</a>.)</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Inviting all to receive the gospel.</i> Reviewing the progress of those who are learning about the gospel, as well as new and returning members. Discussing ways members can share the gospel with others. (See <a>chapter 23</a>.)</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Uniting families for eternity.</i> Reviewing the progress of members who are preparing to receive temple ordinances. Planning ways to help more members qualify for a temple recommend. Discussing ways members can participate in temple and family history work. (See <a>chapter 25</a>.)</p> </li> </ul> As ward council members discuss these matters, they consider the needs and strengths of the members they serve. They can learn about these needs and strengths in presidency meetings, in discussions with members of their organization (including ministering interviews), and through their own ministering efforts. In addition, Leader and Clerk Resources has tools and reports that can help leaders be aware of the progress of members. Council members must keep confidential any private or sensitive information (see 4.4.6 ). The ward council should know the children and youth in the ward and their home circumstances. They pay particular attention to those who do not have gospel support at home. After a discussion, the bishop may either decide on a course of action or postpone a decision while seeking additional information and guidance. Or he could refer the matter to a different council, such as the bishopric. See 4.4.3 . Sometimes the ward council may determine that a ward activity could help meet the needs of members. The ward council may oversee the planning of ward activities. However, most of the planning is done before and after council meetings. For more information about activities, see chapter 20 . After full-time missionaries return home, they may be invited to report on their missions to the ward council (see 24.8.3 ). To understand principles that guide council meetings in the Church, all council members should study 4.3 and 4.4 .\n",

      "29.2.6 Ward Youth Council Meeting Purpose Strengthen the youth in the ward. Help them participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation (see 1.2 ). Participants <ul> <li> <p>The bishopric.</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the bishop’s assistants in the priests quorum and the teachers and deacons quorum presidents.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Young Women class presidents (or the entire presidency if the ward has just one Young Women class).</p> </li> <li> <p>The Young Women president.</p> </li> </ul> The bishop may invite other youth leaders or advisers to attend as needed. Frequency Usually monthly. The bishop may conduct ward youth council meetings. Or he may assign someone else to do so, such as one of his priests quorum assistants or the president of the oldest Young Women class. Ward youth council meetings provide opportunities for youth to lead. The bishopric or other leaders can help them prepare for these meetings during quorum or class presidency meetings. Before each meeting, the bishop and the person conducting review the items to be discussed. These items could include the following: <ul> <li> <p>God’s work of salvation and exaltation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Needs of youth in the ward and ways to address them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Efforts to reach out to youth who are less active or new members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Activities, including opportunities to serve those in need. Most of the planning is done in quorum or class presidency meetings (see <a>chapter 20</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ministering (see <a>chapter 21</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Orienting newly called quorum and class presidencies.</p> </li> </ul> To understand principles that guide council meetings in the Church, all council members should study 4.3 and 4.4 .\n",

The wards’ Sunday meeting schedules could overlap as shown below. Image overlapping meeting schedule This plan may also be considered if the two wards use different languages but the children and youth speak the same language. Using this plan requires the stake president’s approval. If he approves, the bishop of each ward meets with organization leaders to seek their counsel about implementing it. The two bishoprics meet together to determine which members from each ward should be called to serve in quorums and organizations. Each bishop remains the president of his priests quorum, but the two bishops may take turns presiding in Sunday quorum meetings. The bishops from both wards attend combined ward youth council meetings. After implementing the plan, leaders continue to meet regularly to coordinate their efforts.\n",

When Christmas falls on another day of the week, sacrament meeting is the only meeting held on a Sunday near Christmas—usually the Sunday before—as determined by the stake presidency. In some areas, a major non-Christian holiday is culturally significant. When such a holiday falls on a Sunday, the Area Presidency may authorize bishops to hold sacrament meeting only on that day. Stake presidencies may consult with bishops to determine whether to adjust start times for sacrament meetings on these Sundays.\n",

      "29.3.1 Stake Conference Purpose The primary purpose of stake conference is to strengthen members’ faith in Jesus Christ. Participants All are invited to attend the general session. Other sessions are for specific participants, as described below. Frequency Twice each year. Stake conferences are scheduled by the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Usually the stake president presides at one conference each year and an assigned Area Seventy or General Authority presides at the other. The presiding officer directs all planning for the conference. He approves participants and musical selections in advance. For information about music in stake conference, see 19.3.4 . When an Area Seventy or General Authority presides, he may invite the stake president to suggest topics for instruction at the conference. When the stake president presides, he and his counselors select topics. The stake presidency may discuss possible topics with the stake council. In making these selections, the stake presidency considers topics that the First Presidency has emphasized recently. As the stake president makes arrangements for stake conference, he may ask priesthood quorums and other organizations, individuals, and families to help. For example, they could be assigned to set up chairs, provide ushers, and clean the building. Each stake conference normally includes the following meetings: <ul> <li> <p>A meeting of the Area Seventy or General Authority (if assigned) and the stake presidency. The stake clerk and executive secretary also attend.</p> </li> <li> <p>A stake priesthood leadership meeting (see <a>29.3.3</a>). The presiding authority determines whether this meeting is held on Saturday or Sunday. A member of the stake presidency conducts.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Saturday evening session for all stake members 18 and older. Depending on local circumstances, this meeting may be held on Sunday if approved by the presiding authority. A member of the stake presidency conducts.</p> </li> <li> <p>A general session, held on Sunday, for all members and others who would like to attend. The stake president conducts and speaks in this meeting. More than one Sunday general session may be held if there is not room for everyone in one session. Children attend with their families, not in a separate meeting.</p> </li> </ul> If necessary, conference sessions may be streamed to meetinghouses or other locations in the stake. Some members may need the conference to be streamed to their homes. For more about streaming meetings, see 29.7 . Speakers in the general session should not use visual aids or audiovisual materials (see 38.8.3 ). If General Officers, the temple president and matron, the mission president and companion, or the stake patriarch attend, they should sit on the stand. The same is true for counselors in temple and mission presidencies (and their spouses) if they attend in the place of the temple or mission president. In one stake conference each year, a member of the stake presidency presents general, area, and stake officers for sustaining. He uses the Officers Sustained form , prepared by the stake clerk. This is usually done in the first stake conference of the year. If stake officers are called or released between stake conferences, they are presented for sustaining or an expression of thanks in the next stake conference. Or this can be done in each ward’s sacrament meeting. See 30.3 and 30.6 . Brethren who have been recommended to be ordained elders or high priests are presented for sustaining in a stake conference. If a brother needs to be ordained before the next stake conference, he may be sustained in his ward’s sacrament meeting. His name would then be presented for ratifying in a stake conference (see 18.10.3 ).\n",

Such practices may include excessive travel, elaborate public announcements, payments to the family, prolonged feasts, and excessive anniversary celebrations.

Leaders seek the guidance of the Spirit in determining whom to call (see also 4.2.6 ). They also consider: <ul> <li> <p>The member’s worthiness (as determined in an interview).</p> </li> <li> <p>Gifts and abilities the member has, or could develop, to bless others.</p> </li> <li> <p>The member’s personal circumstances, including his or her health and work.</p> </li> <li> <p>The impact the calling may have on the member’s marriage and family.</p> </li> </ul> Each calling should bless the people who are served, the member who serves, and the member’s family. Callings also give members opportunities to grow. Members are blessed for sacrifices they make to serve in the Church. However, a calling should not place undue burdens on individuals and families. Nor should callings make it difficult for members to fulfill their employment responsibilities. Generally, each member is called to serve in only one calling at a time, in addition to being a ministering brother or sister. Exceptions should be rare and prayerfully considered. Not every potential position needs to be filled. When extending a calling to a married member, leaders ensure that the spouse is aware and supportive of the calling. Before extending a calling to a young man or young woman, leaders obtain approval from a parent or guardian. Before a calling is extended, the bishop carefully reviews the person’s membership record to verify that it does not include an annotation or formal membership restrictions. If the calling needs to be extended before the membership record is in the ward, the bishop contacts the member’s previous bishop. Before a stake leader extends a calling, the person’s bishop is consulted to discuss the member’s worthiness and other circumstances that could influence his or her service (such as those described above).\n",

They may also counsel with the bishopric or stake presidency. Bishops and stake presidents carefully consider each recommendation, recognizing that it has been prayerfully made.

      "As a Church leader and servant of Jesus Christ, you also have opportunities to help God’s children, individually, in their spiritual progress. One important way you can do this is through interviews and other one-on-one meetings. Some of your most meaningful service will happen one on one. In these settings, you can give Christlike love, lifting up “the hands which hang down” and strengthening “the feeble knees” ( Doctrine and Covenants 81:5 ).\n",

      "Lenght: 1512\n",
      "31.1.1 Prepare Spiritually If you have the responsibility to meet with a member, the Lord will bless you with the inspiration you need as you seek it. Prepare yourself spiritually through prayer, scripture study, and righteous living. Listen to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. He will guide you with impressions, thoughts, and feelings. He can help you remember teachings you have studied in the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets that can help the person you are meeting with (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ; 100:5–8 ). The Gospel Library has a collection of Counseling Resources . As you prepare to meet with a member, consider reviewing information about topics that apply to him or her. The Holy Ghost can also guide the member with whom you are meeting. You might consider inviting him or her to prepare spiritually for your meeting as well. Consider praying with the member as you begin the meeting. This can invite a spirit of humility and faith as you unitedly ask God for His help (see Doctrine and Covenants 6:32 ; 29:6 ). During the interview or meeting, an issue or question may arise that you don’t feel prepared to address. You might suggest that you and the member each seek the Lord’s guidance—for example, through study, prayer, and fasting. You might also refer to relevant information in Counseling Resources or Life Help in the Gospel Library. Then you can meet again to discuss the matter further. If the member has committed a serious sin, refer him or her to the bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 825\n",
      "31.1.2 Help the Member Feel God’s Love As a Church leader, you represent the Savior. An important part of His mission is to communicate God’s love to His children (see John 3:16–17 ). When members come to you for an interview or for help with a personal challenge, often what they need most is to know that Heavenly Father loves them. This love can strengthen them and inspire them to come unto Christ, repent of sin, and make good choices. The scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets invite the Spirit and teach pure doctrine. Use them often, with sensitivity and love, when you meet with members. Use them to inspire and encourage, not to condemn, coerce, or cause fear (see Luke 9:56 ). Schedule plenty of time for the meeting. The member should not feel that you are too busy. Give him or her your full attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 601\n",
      "31.1.3 Help the Member Draw upon the Savior’s Power Jesus Christ took upon Himself our sins “that he might blot out [our] transgressions according to the power of his deliverance” ( Alma 7:13 ). He also took upon Himself our afflictions, pain, and infirmities “that he may know … how to succor his people” (see Alma 7:11–12 ). Encourage members to turn to Him. Help them draw upon His power to strengthen, comfort, and redeem. This power comes by exercising faith in Jesus Christ, following His example, receiving priesthood ordinances, keeping covenants, and acting on promptings from the Holy Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 1741\n",
      "31.1.4 Help the Member Feel Comfortable and Safe Some members have had experiences that make them feel anxious or overwhelmed when they meet with a Church leader. Seek ways to help them feel calm, safe, and comfortable. Find out from the member what you can do to help. Always give the member the option of having someone else be present during an interview or meeting. When meeting with a member of the opposite sex, a child, or a youth, ensure that a parent or another adult is present. He or she may join the meeting or wait outside the room, depending on the preferences of the member with whom you are meeting. Usually, leaders meet with members in person for interviews and to provide spiritual help and ministering. In deciding where to meet, leaders find a place where the Holy Ghost can be present and they can keep confidences. This could be a classroom or office in the meetinghouse. The leader’s or member’s home may also be an appropriate place to meet. In determining a location, leaders consider their own safety and the safety of the member. For information about meeting with members virtually, see 31.4 . Another important part of helping members feel safe is keeping confidences. Reassure the member that your conversation will be confidential. Do not share confidential information with anyone—including your spouse or other Church leaders—unless the member gives permission. Continue to keep such matters confidential even after you are released. Breaking confidences can harm a member’s faith, trust, and testimony. Members are more likely to seek help from Church leaders if they know that what they share will be kept confidential. For more information about confidentiality, including legal information, see 32.4.4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 665\n",
      "31.1.5 Ask Inspired Questions and Listen Carefully When meeting with a member, ask questions that help you understand his or her situation. Give the member opportunities to express his or her thoughts and feelings freely. While the member is talking, listen carefully and attentively. Seek to understand fully before responding. If needed, ask follow-up questions to be sure you understand. But don’t probe unnecessarily. Listening helps establish trust. It helps others feel understood, valued, and loved. People often need someone they trust to listen as they work through challenges. Listening can also help you open your heart to promptings from the Holy Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenght: 664\n",
      "31.1.6 Encourage Self-Reliance Because of your love for the members, you may want to immediately offer solutions to their problems. However, you will bless them more by helping them find their own solutions and make their own decisions (see Doctrine and Covenants 9:8 ). Help them analyze their problems or questions within the context of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the plan of salvation. Teach them how to seek the Lord’s guidance through the scriptures, the words of living prophets, and personal revelation. In this way, you help members prepare to face other challenges in the future. They will also be better able to help others, including their families.\n",

      "Lenght: 1497\n",
      "31.1.7 Support Efforts to Repent Sometimes a member may seek help repenting of sin. There is much you can do to inspire faith in Jesus Christ and encourage the member to seek forgiveness. Only the bishop or stake president can help a person resolve serious sins. Some of these are listed in 32.6 . If the member has committed any of these sins, he or she should meet with the bishop or stake president right away. Each bishop and stake president is “a judge in Israel” ( Doctrine and Covenants 107:72 ). By this authority they help members repent of sin and come unto Christ, who forgives sin (see 32.1 and 32.3 ). In these responsibilities, these leaders represent the Lord. They strive to use “the judgment which [He] shall give unto [them]” ( 3 Nephi 27:27 ). They teach that repentance includes exercising faith in Jesus Christ, having a contrite spirit, forsaking sin, seeking forgiveness, making restitution, and keeping the commandments with renewed commitment. To help them fulfill their role, bishops and stake presidents are blessed with the spiritual gift of discernment. This gift helps them discern truth, understand a member’s heart, and identify his or her needs (see 1 Kings 3:6–12 ; Doctrine and Covenants 46:27–28 ). Although confession occurs with a “judge in Israel,” with permission of the member, other leaders can give support in his or her efforts to repent. This is especially helpful when repentance will take significant time. See the last part of 32.8.1 for guidelines.\n",

      "Lenght: 686\n",
      "31.1.8 Respond Appropriately to Abuse Abuse cannot be tolerated in any form. Take reports of abuse seriously. If you become aware that someone has been abused, report the abuse to civil authorities and counsel with the bishop. Guidelines for reporting and responding to abuse are provided in 38.6.2 . For information about what bishops and stake presidents should do when they become aware of abuse, see 38.6.2.1 . For information about helping victims of abuse, see “ Abuse (Help for the Victim) ” in Counseling Resources . You can also refer members to helpful resources about abuse in Life Help .

The missionary uses the following questions. He adapts them to the person’s age, maturity, and circumstance. <ol> <li> <p>Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?

      "31.3.1 Meeting with Youth The bishop’s foremost responsibility is to help the rising generation in his ward progress spiritually. One important way he does this is by meeting with the youth individually (or with another adult present; see 31.1.4 ). The bishop or one of his counselors meets with each youth twice a year. At least one of these meetings each year should be with the bishop. Beginning the year the youth turns 16, both meetings during the year should be with the bishop if possible. In addition to these meetings, youth should feel free to counsel with the bishop whenever they need guidance or support. The bishop strives to build strong, trusting relationships with the youth so they feel comfortable counseling with him. The Young Women president also has a responsibility to minister to individual young women. She can do this by meeting with young women one on one (or with another adult present; see 31.1.4 ). When they meet with youth, leaders follow the principles in 31.1 . Many of these principles are especially important when meeting with youth. 31.3.1.1 Communicating with Parents In their efforts to strengthen the youth, leaders work closely with parents. They seek to support parents in their responsibility for teaching their children the gospel of Jesus Christ. Leaders share the following information with the youth and his or her parents before their first meeting: <ul> <li> <p>Parents have the primary responsibility to teach and nurture their children.</p> </li> <li> <p>The bishop or one of his counselors meets with each youth at least twice a year.

These meetings should be uplifting spiritual experiences. Leaders strive to help each youth feel loved, encouraged, and inspired to become more like the Savior. The youth and the leader could discuss: <ul> <li> <p>Spiritual experiences that are building the youth’s testimony of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the restored gospel.</p> </li> <li> <p>How the youth is keeping his or her baptismal covenants.</p> </li> <li> <p>The youth’s preparations to make and keep temple covenants.</p> </li> <li> <p>The youth’s personal goals to become more like the Savior in all areas of life (see “<a>Children and Youth</a>”).</p> </li> <li> <p>The importance of personal and family prayer and scripture study.</p> </li> <li> <p>How to strengthen relationships with parents and other family members.</p> </li> <li> <p>The principles in <a><cite>For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices</cite></a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ways the youth can participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation (see <a>1.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>With a young man, his experiences fulfilling his priesthood duties and his preparation to be ordained to the next priesthood office.</p> </li> <li> <p>The blessings of participating in seminary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preparing to serve a full-time mission (see <a>24.0</a> and <a>24.3</a>).

The Lord also welcomes worthy, able young women to serve missions if they desire. For young women, a mission is a powerful, but optional, opportunity.

The bishop may assign others in the ward, such as the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies, to meet with members who have temporal needs. However, only the bishop can approve the use of fast-offering funds (see 22.6.1 ). Additional principles and policies for helping those with temporal needs are described in chapter 22 .\n",

While divorce is an appropriate option in some situations, such decisions must remain with the individual. Following the guidance of the Spirit, Church leaders often meet with couples and individuals who are separating or getting a divorce. Leaders can also seek to help a couple strengthen their marriage. They teach about the strength and healing that come from keeping covenants they have made with the Lord and living His teachings. These teachings include faith, repentance, forgiveness, love, and prayer. A member who is separated from his or her spouse or is going through a divorce should not date until the divorce is final.\n",

      "31.3.6 Professional Counseling and Therapy Church leaders are not called to be professional counselors or to provide therapy. The assistance they give is spiritual, focusing on the strengthening, comforting, redeeming power of Jesus Christ. In addition to this important and inspired help, some members may benefit from professional counseling where it is available. Such counseling or therapy can help members understand and respond to life’s challenges in healthy ways. Meeting with a professional counselor to gain insight and skills for emotional well-being is not a sign of weakness. Rather, it can be a sign of humility and strength. Members should carefully select reputable professional counselors who have applicable licensing. Counselors should respect the agency, values, and beliefs of those seeking help. Incorporating these values is ethically appropriate in professional counseling. When members seek counseling about physical intimacy, bishops may refer them to professionals who specialize in such counseling and whose beliefs and practices are consistent with Church doctrine. The Church opposes any therapy, including conversion or reparative therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity, that subjects a person to abusive practices. (See “ Same-Sex Attraction ” and “ Transgender ” in Life Help .) In the United States and Canada, bishops and stake presidents may contact Family Services to identify resources to provide professional counseling in harmony with gospel principles. Contact information is given below: 1-801-240-1711 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-1711 FamilyServices.ChurchofJesusChrist.org In other areas, leaders may contact Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager in the area office.

      "32.4.1 Confession Repentance requires that sins be confessed to Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ said, “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them” ( Doctrine and Covenants 58:43 ; see also Mosiah 26:29 ). When Church members commit serious sins, their repentance also includes confession to their bishop or stake president. He is then able to exercise the keys of the gospel of repentance on their behalf (see Doctrine and Covenants 13:1 ; 84:26–27 ; 107:18, 20 ). This helps them heal and return to the gospel path through the power of the Savior’s Atonement. The purpose of confession is to encourage members to unburden themselves so they can fully seek the Lord’s help in changing and healing. Developing a “broken heart and a contrite spirit” is aided by confession ( 2 Nephi 2:7 ). Voluntary confession shows that a person desires to repent. When a member confesses, the bishop or stake president follows the guidelines for counseling in 32.8 . He prayerfully seeks guidance about the appropriate setting for helping the member repent (see 32.5 ). He considers whether a membership council would be helpful. If Church policy requires a membership council, he explains this (see 32.6 and 32.10 ). Sometimes a member has wronged a spouse or another adult. As part of repentance, he or she should usually confess to that person and seek forgiveness. A youth who commits a serious sin is usually encouraged to counsel with his or her parents.\n",

      "32.4.2 Serious Sins That Are Not Confessed or Are Denied A bishop or stake president typically learns about a serious sin through confession or from another person. He may also receive promptings about a potential serious sin through the Holy Ghost. If he feels prompted by the Spirit that someone may be struggling with sin, he may schedule an interview. During the interview, he shares his concerns in a kind, respectful way. He avoids any tone of accusation. If a member denies committing a serious sin that the bishop or stake president has information to support, a membership council may still be held.

      "32.4.3 Gathering Information Before holding a membership council, the bishop or stake president gathers as much information as he needs. Information from a member’s confession is often sufficient. Information may also come from a family member, another Church leader, a victim, or a participant in the sin. When gathering information, the bishop or stake president should only use methods that are appropriate for a priesthood leader. He should not keep a watch on a person’s home or record him or her without consent. Nor should he use any practices that are against the law. False accusations are rare but can occur. Priesthood leaders should be cautious when there is limited information besides one person’s word. For example, a member who is accused of adultery may deny the charge. The scriptures explain that “every word shall be established against him or her by two witnesses of the church” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:80 ). “Two witnesses” means two separate sources of information. This could include the knowledge of a participant and some other reliable source. At times a priesthood leader may need to wait to act until more information becomes available. When a Church leader is gathering information for a membership council, he should immediately stop if he learns that law enforcement is actively investigating the member. This is done to avoid possible claims that the leader may have obstructed justice. For legal advice about these situations in the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the Church’s Office of General Counsel: 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301 1-801-240-6301 Outside the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office. Normally a membership council is not held to consider conduct being examined by a civil or criminal trial court until the court has reached a final judgment. In some cases it may also be appropriate to delay a membership council until the period of legal appeal has expired or the appeal has been rejected.\n",

      "32.4.4 Confidentiality Bishops, stake presidents, and their counselors have a sacred duty to protect all confidential information shared with them. This information may come in interviews, counseling, and confessions. The same duty of confidentiality applies to all who take part in membership councils. Confidentiality is essential because members may not confess sins or seek guidance if what they share will not be kept confidential. Breaching a confidence betrays members’ trust and causes them to lose confidence in their leaders. Consistent with their duty of confidentiality, a bishop, stake president, or their counselors may share such information only as follows: <ul> <li> <p>They need to confer with the member’s stake president, mission president, or bishop about holding a membership council or related matters. The stake president may also confer with his assigned Area Seventy. If needed, the Area Seventy refers the stake president to the Area Presidency.

He also informs the leader if the member may pose a threat to others.</p> </li> <li> <p>A bishop or stake president learns that a Church member who lives outside the ward or stake may have been involved in a serious sin. In that instance, he confidentially contacts that member’s bishop.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is necessary to disclose information during a membership council. All information gathered and shared as part of a membership council is confidential.</p> </li> <li> <p>A member chooses to give permission for the leader to share information with specific persons. These may include parents, Church leaders, or others who may provide support. The leader does not share information beyond the permission the member has given.</p> </li> <li> <p>It may be necessary to share limited information about the decision of a membership council (see <a>32.12.2</a>).</p> </li> </ul> In all other situations, the leader should refer to 32.4.5 . These cases include when the law may require that a crime, such as child abuse, be reported to government authorities. To assist leaders in protecting others and complying with the law, the Church provides help from trained professionals. To receive this guidance, leaders promptly call the Church’s abuse help line where it is available (see 32.4.5 and 38.6.2.1 ). Where it is not available, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office. In only one situation should a bishop or stake president disclose confidential information without first seeking such guidance. That is when disclosure is necessary to prevent life-threatening harm or serious injury and there is not time to seek guidance. In such cases, the duty to protect others is more important than the duty of confidentiality. Leaders should contact civil authorities immediately. If leaders keep notes or communicate with each other electronically, they safeguard access to this information. They also delete or destroy the information when they no longer need it. They do not unnecessarily share personal information. Civil authorities might challenge the confidentiality required of a priesthood leader. If this occurs in the United States and Canada, the stake president seeks legal advice from the Church’s Office of General Counsel: 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301 1-801-240-6301 Outside the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office.\n",

      "32.4.5 Reporting to Government Authorities Some people who are repenting have broken civil or criminal laws. In some cases, government authorities are not aware of this. Bishops and stake presidents encourage members to follow the law and report such matters when required. Leaders also counsel members to obtain competent legal advice when reporting. The Church’s policy is to obey the law. In many places, priesthood leaders are required by law to report some illegal behaviors of which they become aware. For example, some states and countries require that child abuse be reported to law enforcement authorities. In some countries, the Church has established a confidential abuse help line to assist bishops and stake presidents. These leaders should promptly call the help line about every situation in which a person may have been abused—or is at risk of being abused (see 38.6.2.1 ). It is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In countries that do not have a help line, a bishop who learns of abuse should contact his stake president, who should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office.

Murder does not include police or military acts in the line of duty. Abortion is not defined as murder in this context. If death was caused by accident or by defense of self or others, the taking of a human life might not be defined as murder. This may also be true in other situations, such as when a person has limited mental capacity. Rape. A membership council is required for rape.

As used here, rape does not include consensual sexual intercourse between two minors who are close in age. Sexual Assault Conviction. A membership council is required if a member is convicted of sexual assault. Child or Youth Abuse. A membership council is required if a person abuses a child or youth as explained in 38.6.2.3 . Abuse of a Spouse or Another Adult. There is a spectrum of severity in abusive behavior. See 38.6.2.4 for when a membership council is required for abuse of a spouse or another adult. Violent Predatory Behavior. A membership council is required if an adult repeatedly harms people physically through violent behavior and is a threat to others. 32.6.1.2 Sexual Immorality Incest.

A membership council is required if a person knowingly enters into a plural marriage. Some plural marriages may occur in secret, with a spouse not knowing about one or more other spouses. Withdrawing a person’s Church membership is required if a person knowingly enters into plural marriage. Sexual Predatory Behavior. A membership council is required if an adult repeatedly harms people sexually and is a threat to others. 32.6.1.3 Fraudulent Acts Financial Predatory Behavior. A membership council is required if an adult has a history of deliberately and repeatedly harming people financially and is a threat to others (see 38.6.2.4 ). This includes investment fraud and similar activities. Unintended financial losses due to economic conditions are not considered fraudulent.

      "32.6.2 When a Membership Council May Be Necessary A membership council may be necessary in the following instances. 32.6.2.1 Violent Acts and Abuse The Lord commanded, “Thou shalt not … kill, nor do anything like unto it ” ( Doctrine and Covenants 59:6 ; italics added). Violent acts and abuse for which a membership council may be necessary include (but are not limited to) those listed below. Attempted Murder. Deliberately trying to kill someone. Sexual Abuse, Including Assault and Harassment. Sexual abuse covers a broad range of actions (see 38.6.18 ). A membership council may be necessary for a person who has sexually assaulted or abused someone. A council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. See 38.6.18.3 for when a council is required. Abuse of a Spouse or Another Adult. There is a spectrum of severity in abusive behavior (see 38.6.2.4 ). A membership council may be necessary for a person who has abused a spouse or another adult. A council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. See 38.6.2.4 for when a council is required. 32.6.2.2 Sexual Immorality The Lord’s law of chastity is abstinence from sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman (see Exodus 20:14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 63:16 ). A membership council may be necessary for sexual immorality as described in 38.6.5 . In these situations, a council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. See 32.6.1.2 for when a council is required. 32.6.2.3 Fraudulent Acts The Ten Commandments teach, “Thou shalt not steal” or “bear false witness” ( Exodus 20:15–16 ). A membership council may be necessary for acts such as robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, perjury, and fraud. In these situations, a council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. See 32.6.1.3 for when a council is required for fraudulent acts. See 32.6.3.3 if a member was involved in embezzlement of Church funds or property. See 38.8.2 for affinity fraud. 32.6.2.4 Violations of Trust A membership council may be necessary if a member: <ul> <li> <p>Commits a serious sin while holding a position of authority or trust in the Church or the community.</p> </li> <li> <p>Commits a serious sin that is widely known.</p> </li> </ul> In these situations, a council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. See 32.6.1.4 for when a council is required. See 32.6.3.3 if a member was involved in embezzlement of Church funds or property. 32.6.2.5 Some Other Acts King Benjamin taught, “I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them” ( Mosiah 4:29 ). A council may be necessary if a person: <ul> <li> <p>Shows a pattern of committing serious sins (see <a>Doctrine and Covenants 82:7</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Deliberately abandons family responsibilities, including nonpayment of child support and alimony.</p> </li> <li> <p>Threatens physical violence, whether in person or online (see <a>32.2.1</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sells illegal drugs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Commits other serious criminal acts.</p> </li> </ul> In these situations, a council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. A membership council may be necessary if a member submits to, performs, arranges for, pays for, or encourages an abortion. See 38.6.1 for guidelines.

      "32.6.3 When the Stake President Counsels with the Area Presidency about Whether a Membership Council or Other Action Is Necessary Some matters require extra sensitivity and guidance. To know how to best help, the stake president must counsel with the Area Presidency about the situations in this section. However, only the stake president decides if a council should be held to address the conduct. If a council is held, the stake president or bishop decides the outcome. If a membership council is held for one of the matters outlined in this section, the decision of the council must be “remains in good standing,” “formal membership restrictions,” or “withdrawal of membership.” First Presidency approval is required to remove formal restrictions or readmit the person into the Church (see 32.16.1, number 9 ). 32.6.3.1 Other Action If a membership council is not held, other action could include: <ul> <li> <p>Informal membership restrictions (see <a>32.8.3</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Membership record annotation (see <a>32.14.5</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ordinance restrictions, which restrict a person from receiving or exercising the priesthood or receiving or using a temple recommend.</p> </li> </ul> A stake president counsels with the Area Presidency before one of these actions is taken. 32.6.3.2 Apostasy Issues of apostasy often have an impact beyond the boundaries of a ward or stake. They need to be addressed promptly to protect others. The bishop counsels with the stake president if he feels that a member’s action may constitute apostasy. The bishop or stake president may place informal membership restrictions on the member (see 32.8.3 ). The stake president promptly counsels with the Area Presidency. However, only the stake president decides whether a membership council or other action is necessary. As used here, apostasy refers to a member engaging in any of the following: <ul> <li> <p>Repeatedly acting in clear and deliberate public opposition to the Church, its doctrine, its policies, or its leaders</p> </li> <li> <p>Persisting in teaching as Church doctrine what is not Church doctrine after being corrected by the bishop or stake president</p> </li> <li> <p>Showing a pattern of intentionally working to weaken the faith and activity of Church members</p> </li> <li> <p>Continuing to follow the teachings of apostate sects after being corrected by the bishop or stake president</p> </li> <li> <p>Formally joining another church and promoting its teachings (Total inactivity in the Church or attending another church does not by itself constitute apostasy. However, if a member formally joins another church and advocates its teachings, withdrawing his or her membership may be necessary.)</p> </li> </ul> The Savior taught the Nephites that they should continue to minister to a person who has sinned. “But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people” ( 3 Nephi 18:31 ). 32.6.3.3 Embezzling Church Funds If a member embezzles Church funds or steals valuable Church property, the stake president counsels with the Area Presidency about whether a membership council or other action may be necessary. Leaders consider: <ul> <li> <p>The amount embezzled or stolen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whether the embezzlement was a one-time event or a repetition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whether repayment has occurred.</p> </li> <li> <p>The person’s level of remorse.</p> </li> <li> <p>The position held by the member (see <a>32.6.1.4</a> for members holding a prominent Church position).</p> </li> </ul> The stake president reports one of the following in Leader and Clerk Resources : <ul> <li> <p>The results of a membership council</p> </li> <li> <p>That he counseled with the Area Presidency and determined a membership council was not necessary</p> </li> </ul> If the Church Auditing Department determines that a leader or Church employee has embezzled Church funds or property, the First Presidency generally directs that his or her membership record will be annotated. “Leader” is defined as a person holding a prominent Church position, as well as counselors, clerks, and branch presidencies. When repentance is complete, a stake president may request removal of the annotation (see 32.14.5 and 34.7.5 ). An annotation does not mean a membership council or other action has occurred. 32.6.3.4 Individuals Who Identify as Transgender Bishops and stake presidents working with persons who identify as transgender should follow the guidelines in 38.6.23 .\n",

For youth, he may assign the Young Women presidency or Aaronic Priesthood quorum advisers to assist. Those who are assigned to assist are entitled to inspiration to fulfill that assignment (see 4.2.6 ).

These addictions may include substances or a wide range of behaviors. Addictions harm individuals, marriages, and families. Bishops may counsel members to seek help from the Church’s Healing through the Savior: The Addiction Recovery Program and from qualified medical and mental health professionals. Only the Church’s official program should be sponsored or hosted in Church buildings. Pornography use is becoming increasingly common. Whether pornography use is intensive or occasional, it is harmful. It drives away the Spirit. It weakens the ability to draw on power that comes from keeping covenants. It also harms precious relationships. Personal counseling and informal membership restrictions are usually sufficient for helping a person repent of using pornography. Membership councils are not usually held. For exceptions, see 38.6.6 and 38.6.13 . Professional counseling may be helpful. Stake presidents and bishops support family members as needed. Parents could be included when counseling youth about pornography use. The spouse may be included when counseling a married person.

      "32.8.3 Informal Membership Restrictions In addition to encouraging positive actions when counseling, a bishop or stake president may informally restrict some Church membership privileges for a time. Wisely administered, these restrictions can help with repentance and spiritual progress. They are considered informal because they are not noted on a membership record. Informal restrictions may last a few weeks, several months, or longer if necessary for the person to repent fully. In unusual circumstances, the time could be longer than one year. Leaders seek the guidance of the Spirit about which restrictions would best help a person repent. These could include (but are not limited to) suspending the privilege of serving in a Church calling, exercising the priesthood, or entering a temple. The leader could also restrict the person from giving a talk, lesson, or prayer in Church settings. If the leader suspends the right to enter a temple, he cancels the temple recommend in Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR) . Partaking of the sacrament is an important part of repentance. It should not be the first restriction given to a repentant person who has a broken heart and contrite spirit. However, if a person has committed serious sins, a leader may suspend this privilege for a time. Leaders normally do not tell anyone else about informal restrictions unless there is a need to know (see 32.12.2 ). The bishop or stake president may remove informal restrictions as guided by the Spirit when the person makes specified progress in genuine repentance. If the member continues in the pattern of sin, it may be helpful or necessary to hold a membership council.\n",

      "32.10.2 Obtain Statements from Victims When a Church member is a victim (such as for incest, child abuse, spouse abuse, or fraud), the bishop or stake president contacts that person’s current bishop or stake president. These leaders determine whether it would be helpful to give the victim an opportunity to provide a written statement about the misconduct and its effects. These statements may be read in a membership council (see 32.10.3, number 3 ). Church leaders do not have authority to initiate contact with victims who are not members of the Church. Any communication with a victim for this purpose is made by his or her current bishop or stake president. If a victim provides a statement, this leader gives it to the bishop or stake president who holds the membership council. Leaders must take great care to avoid causing further trauma. See 32.4.3 for other cautions. Any inquiry about a victim who is under 18 is made through the child’s parents or legal guardians, unless doing so could put the victim at risk. For information about bishops and stake presidents receiving guidance in cases of abuse, see 32.4.5 and 38.6.2.1 .\n",

A person can also resign membership by sending a signed, notarized request to Church headquarters. A minor who wishes to resign his or her Church membership follows the same procedure as an adult, with one exception: the request should be signed by the minor (if over the age of 8) and by the parent(s) or guardian(s) who have legal custody of the minor. If a member resigning membership threatens legal action against the Church or its leaders, the stake president follows the instructions in 38.8.23 . A request to resign membership should be acted on even if priesthood leaders have information about a serious sin. Any information about unresolved sins is noted when the request is submitted through LCR . This allows priesthood leaders to resolve such matters in the future if the person applies for readmission into the Church (see 32.16.2 ). A priesthood leader should not recommend resigning Church membership in order to avoid holding a membership council.

      "32.16.1 Membership Councils to Remove Formal Restrictions or Readmit a Person When membership privileges are restricted or withdrawn in a membership council, another council must be held to consider removing the restrictions or readmitting the person to the Church. This council should also have the same level of authority (or higher) as the initial council. For example, if a stake or mission president presided over the initial council, a stake or mission president presides over the council to consider removing the restrictions or readmitting the person. The current bishop or stake president holds the council. He first ensures that the person has repented and is ready and worthy to enjoy the blessings of Church membership. Those who have had their Church membership formally restricted usually need to show genuine repentance for at least one year before consideration is given to removing the restrictions. Those who have had their Church membership withdrawn almost always need to show genuine repentance for at least one year before they can be considered for readmission. For a member who held a prominent Church position at the time of the serious sin, the period is generally longer (see 32.6.1.4 ). A council to consider removing restrictions or readmitting a person to the Church follows the same guidelines as other membership councils. A bishop needs approval from the stake president to hold the council. In a mission, a branch or district president needs approval from the mission president. The following guidelines apply when holding a membership council to consider removing Church membership restrictions or readmitting a person to the Church. Not all of these guidelines may apply in each case. <ol> <li> <p><i>Review the initial membership council.</i> The bishop or stake president reviews the Report of Church Membership Council form. He requests a copy through <a>LCR</a>. After reviewing the form, he may contact the bishop or stake president where the initial council was held to seek clarification.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Interview the person.</i> The bishop or stake president interviews the person thoroughly to discern the strength of his or her faith in Jesus Christ and the extent of repentance. He also determines whether the person has met the conditions outlined in the initial action.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Determine the status of criminal or civil court action.</i> Sometimes a person has admitted to or has been convicted of a crime. Sometimes a person has been found liable in a civil action of fraud or other illegal acts. In these cases, the leader generally does not hold a council until the person has fulfilled all the conditions of any sentence, order, or judgment made by legal authorities. These conditions may include imprisonment, probation, parole, and fines or restitution. Exceptions require the approval of the First Presidency before holding a membership council. These exceptions might include someone who has completed legal requirements and has shown genuine repentance but is on lifelong probation or has a substantial fine.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Contact the priesthood leaders of the victims.</i> The bishop or stake president contacts the current bishop or stake president of any victims (see <a>32.10.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Give notice of the council.</i> He notifies the person of the date, time, and place of the council.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Conduct the council.</i> He conducts the council according to the guidelines in <a>32.10.3</a>. He asks the person what he or she has done to repent. He also asks about his or her commitment to Jesus Christ and the Church. When all relevant matters have been presented, he excuses the member. With his counselors, he prays to consider what action to take. The three possible decisions are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Continue membership restrictions or withdrawal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove restrictions or authorize readmission.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recommend to the First Presidency that restrictions be removed or readmission be authorized (if necessary according to “Apply for First Presidency approval” below).</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p><i>Share the decision.</i> After the council makes a decision, the presiding officer shares it with the person.

He may ask the clerk to prepare this report. He ensures that no hard copy or electronic copy is retained locally. He also ensures that all notes used to prepare the report are promptly destroyed.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Apply for First Presidency approval (if necessary).</i> In the following circumstances, the approval of the First Presidency is necessary to remove formal membership restrictions or readmit the person into the Church.

      "32.16.2 Being Readmitted after Resigning Church Membership If a person formally resigns Church membership, he or she must be baptized and confirmed to be readmitted into the Church. For adults, readmission is not usually considered until at least one year after resigning membership. When a person requests readmission, the bishop or stake president obtains a copy of the Report of Administrative Action form that accompanied the request for resignation. He can obtain this through LCR. The bishop or stake president then interviews the person thoroughly. He asks about the reasons for the original request and the desire for readmission. In a spirit of love, he asks about serious sins the person may have committed either before or after resigning membership. The leader does not proceed with readmission until he is satisfied that the person has repented and is ready and worthy to enjoy the blessings of Church membership. Guidelines for readmission after resignation follow: <ul> <li> <p>A membership council is held if the person’s membership was formally restricted at the time of resignation.</p> </li> <li> <p>A membership council is held if the person committed a serious sin, including apostasy, before resigning membership.</p> </li> </ul> In other circumstances, a membership council is not held unless the bishop or stake president determines that it would be needed.

If the person engaged in any of the conduct in 32.14.5, number 1 , either before or after resigning membership, an annotation will be made on the membership record. A person who requests readmission must meet the same qualifications as others who are baptized.

All members who have income should pay tithing. The Lord’s covenant people have lived the law of tithing since ancient times (see Genesis 14:18–20 ; Leviticus 27:30–32 ). The Lord has said, “The tithing of my people … shall be a standing law unto them forever” ( Doctrine and Covenants 119:3–4 ). Tithes are holy to the Lord, and members honor Him by paying tithing. This is an expression of faith in God and His promises. Those who pay tithing receive this promise from the Lord: “Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” ( Malachi 3:10 ). 34.3.1.1 Use of Tithing Funds Tithing donations are always used for the Lord’s purposes, as directed by the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes (see Doctrine and Covenants 120 ). Some of these purposes are outlined in 34.0 . 34.3.1.2 Tithing Declaration The bishop meets with each member during the last few months of each year to receive his or her tithing declaration. In rare circumstances when the bishop is absent, the stake president may authorize one of the bishop’s counselors to fulfill this responsibility. All members are invited to meet with the bishop to: <ul> <li> <p>Declare to the bishop their status as tithe payers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure their contribution records are accurate.</p> </li> </ul> Whenever possible, all members of a family, including children, should attend together. During tithing declaration, the bishop expresses appreciation to members for their faithfulness. He also teaches the principle of tithing, encourages members to give a generous fast offering, and discusses other relevant matters.

In deciding this, the bishop considers the number of Aaronic Priesthood holders available, their safety, and the blessing to members who might not otherwise contribute. Priesthood holders should go in pairs when gathering fast offerings. They deliver fast offerings promptly to a member of the bishopric.

In some areas, units may be approved to use bank cards. No stake or ward expenses may be incurred or paid without the presiding officer’s authorization. Two authorized leaders must approve each payment. One of them must be a member of the stake presidency or bishopric. Although counselors may be authorized to approve payments, the stake president or bishop must review each payment. Leaders should not approve a payment to themselves.

Written approval from a member of the Area Presidency is required before a bishop may use fast offerings or approve a bishop’s order for the stake president or his family. See 22.5.1.2 for guidelines. A member requesting reimbursement provides a physical or electronic copy of any receipts or invoices. He or she also includes the purpose, amount, and date of the purchase. If funds are advanced, the member submits a payment request form, noting the purpose, amount, and date. After the expense has been paid, the member then (1) provides receipts or invoices for the funds spent and (2) returns any unspent funds. Returned funds should be redeposited. Authorized leaders and clerks should not approve payments without carefully reviewing the expense and receipts or invoices. Stakes and wards may not open their own bank accounts or maintain a petty cash fund. 34.5.7.1 Image icon, optional resources Electronic Payments If the stake or ward uses electronic payments, members are encouraged to enter their personal bank account details in the Expense Reimbursement Account section under Settings in Online Donations at donations.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .

In such cases, the stake presidents counsel together about the use and scheduling of the building. They may contact the Area Seventy for direction as needed. Approval from the director for temporal affairs and the Area Presidency is required before using a meetinghouse to establish a gathering place for young single adults where additional nonstandard equipment or resources are being requested. To seek approval, the stake president contacts the facilities manager. All who use the meetinghouse should show consideration for others. Every effort should be made to accommodate others’ needs. Such efforts include scheduling the use of spaces, controlling noise, and keeping use within the scheduled time. For more information about Church activities, see chapter 20 .\n",

For example, meetinghouses may not be used to support any kind of business. Nor may resources within meetinghouses, such as bulletin boards, be used to support a business (see 38.8.5 ). Such use does not align with the purposes of Church properties. It could also conflict with local or national laws that may allow tax exemption of Church property (see 34.8.1 ). The following are examples of commercial uses that are not approved: <ul> <li> <p>Promoting or sponsoring businesses or investments</p> </li> <li> <p>Buying, selling, or promoting products, services, publications, or creative works</p> </li> <li> <p>Holding unauthorized fundraising activities (see <a>20.6.5</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Hosting or accommodating choirs, speakers, instructors, educational groups, or other service providers who receive a fee for seminars, lessons (except for private piano or organ instruction; see <a>19.7.2</a>), classes, or other activities</p> </li> <li> <p>Renting space for weddings or wedding-related events</p> </li> </ul> 35.5.6.2 Homeschooling and Childcare Uses The Church strongly supports education and families. However, meetinghouses are not used for homeschooling or as childcare facilities. Adherence to this policy will promote safety and avoid tax liabilities for the Church. 35.5.6.3 Political Purposes The Church is politically neutral. Church property may not be used for political or advocacy purposes. Prohibited activities include political meetings and use by political campaigns and advocacy groups. Announcements related to political purposes may not be made on Church property, such as on bulletin boards. However, using properties for voter registration or voting may be allowed as an exception (see 38.8.30 ). The stake president may obtain such an exception through the facilities manager (see 35.5.4 ). 35.5.6.4 Other Uses The following uses of Church meetinghouse property are generally not approved: <ul> <li> <p>Providing overnight shelter (except in emergencies; see <a>35.5.5</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Camping</p> </li> <li> <p>Renting or leasing Church buildings and properties</p> </li> </ul> These guidelines apply to the meetinghouse itself as well as to all Church-owned property and facilities surrounding the meetinghouse.

      "35.5.7 Other Policies and Standards That Apply to All Uses 35.5.7.1 Chapels Chapels are rooms where members worship and partake of the sacrament. Meetings and activities held in chapels should be in harmony with these purposes. For guidelines about holding cultural arts events, concerts, and other presentations in chapels, see 19.3.5 . 35.5.7.2 Firearms and Weapons Firearms and other lethal weapons are not allowed on Church property. This includes concealed weapons. This does not apply to current law enforcement officers. 35.5.7.3 Kitchens and Serving Areas Kitchens and serving areas may be used to serve meals and refreshments and to keep food warm or cold. In some locations, food preparation in kitchens is allowed. However, in the United States, Canada, and some other countries, food-handling regulations often require certification, commercial equipment, or government inspection. In these areas, food should be prepared elsewhere and brought to the meetinghouse. Food preparation demonstrations are an exception and are allowed even where these regulations exist. Facilities managers can provide guidance for each area. For more information, see safety.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Image group eating 35.5.7.4 Parking Lots Use of Church parking lots should comply with the guidelines in this chapter. In addition, parking lots should not be used for commuter parking or other similar uses without permission from the director for temporal affairs. Leaders may contact the facilities manager with requests. Personal vehicles and other personal equipment may not be stored on Church property. For more information about parking lots and accessible parking, see “ Meetinghouse Parking Lots ” ( Meetinghouse Facilities Guide ). 35.5.7.5 Storage Only maintenance equipment and approved supplies may be stored in buildings. Welfare items may be stored in meetinghouses during emergencies (see 35.5.5 ). Leaders may contact the facilities manager with questions. 35.5.7.6 Additional Information More information about using Church property is available at “ Other Information Related to Meetinghouse Facilities ” ( Meetinghouse Facilities Guide ).

Streaming is permitted, for example, when the close family member: <ul> <li> <p>Lives in a remote location or has limited ability to travel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Has physical, mental, or emotional health challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is immunocompromised or in a care facility or hospital.</p> </li> <li> <p>Needs sign-language interpretation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is serving a full-time mission.

The stake president may authorize the streaming of Melchizedek Priesthood ordinations and the setting apart of missionaries. The ordinance of the sacrament is not streamed. If a sacrament meeting is being livestreamed, the stream should be paused during the administration of the sacrament. The bishop may authorize a priest or Melchizedek Priesthood holder to administer the sacrament in person to those who cannot attend the meeting (see 18.9.1 ). Streaming of ordinances should not distract from the Spirit. Generally, only one device should be used. It is operated by the ward or stake technology specialist.

Ordinances should not be withheld if the person is worthy, wants to receive them, and shows sufficient responsibility and accountability. The bishop may counsel with the stake president if he has questions about specific persons. The stake president may contact the Office of the First Presidency if necessary.

In some cases, an ordinance must be performed again. When this happens, a clerk records the new date on the membership record, even if it is out of sequence with the dates of other ordinances. 38.2.6.1 A Membership Record Was Not Created or the Year Is Missing or Incorrect For record-keeping purposes, an ordinance is considered not valid if the year it was performed is missing or incorrect on the membership record. In addition, a baptism is not valid if a membership record was not created. The ordinance can be validated with the original certificate that was issued when the ordinance was performed. With this certificate, the bishop can authorize a clerk to update the membership record. If the certificate cannot be found, the ordinance can be validated with the testimony of two people who witnessed it. The two witnesses should: <ul> <li> <p>Have been 8 years old or older when the ordinance was performed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have seen or heard the ordinance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be Church members of record at the time they give their testimony.</p> </li> <li> <p>Give their testimony in writing, stating either (1) the complete date the ordinance was performed or (2) the year it was performed and the person who performed it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sign their testimony in the presence of a member of the bishopric or stake presidency.</p> </li> </ul> With this testimony, the bishop can authorize a clerk to create or update the membership record. The written testimony may then be discarded. If the certificate or witnesses cannot be found, the ordinance must be performed again. If the member has received other ordinances after the invalid ordinance, they must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. 38.2.6.2 Ordinances Were Received out of Sequence An ordinance is not valid if a person received it out of sequence. For example, a man’s endowment is not valid if he received it before receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood. However, the First Presidency may ratify such an ordinance. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. 38.2.6.3 The Ordinance Was Performed before the Appropriate Age An ordinance is not valid if it was performed before the appropriate age. For example, a baptism is not valid if it was performed before the person was 8 years old. If no other ordinances were received after the invalid ordinance, it should be performed again. If other ordinances were received, those and the invalid ordinance must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. 38.2.6.4 The Ordinance Was Performed without the Proper Authority An ordinance is not valid if it was performed by someone who did not have the proper priesthood authority. For example, a confirmation is not valid if it was performed by someone who did not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. Similarly, it is not valid if the person performing it received the Melchizedek Priesthood out of sequence or without proper approval (see 38.2.6.2 ; see also 32.17 ). If no other ordinances were received after the invalid ordinance, it should be performed again by someone with the proper authority. If other ordinances were received, those and the invalid ordinance must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency.

If the person is a potential convert, the mission president holds the keys for his or her baptism (see 18.7.1.2 ). In this case, the missionaries inform the mission president. He counsels with the person and his or her parents or guardians (where applicable) to determine whether he or she should be baptized and confirmed. If the bishop knows the person well, the mission president may also seek his input. Those who are not accountable do not need to be baptized, regardless of age (see Doctrine and Covenants 29:46–50 and 38.2.4 in this handbook). For information about the membership records of persons who may not be accountable, see 33.6.10 . 38.2.8.2 Minors A minor, as defined by local laws, may be baptized when both of the following conditions are met: <ol> <li> <p>The parents or legal guardians give permission. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the baptism. Exceptions require the approval of the First Presidency.</p> <p>The person who conducts the baptism and confirmation interview asks for this permission to be in writing if he feels it will help prevent misunderstandings. In some locations, written permission is required. Mission and area leaders can provide guidance.</p> <p>Parents or guardians should understand the doctrine their child will be taught. They should also be willing to support the child in making and keeping the baptismal covenant.</p> </li> <li> <p>The person who conducts the interview discerns that the child understands the baptismal covenant. He should feel confident that the child will strive to keep this covenant by obeying the commandments, including attending Church meetings.</p> </li> </ol> If a child goes by the surname of his or her stepfather, the child may be baptized and confirmed in that name. This is true even if he or she has not been formally adopted. However, the child’s legal name, as defined by local law or custom, should be recorded on the membership record and the baptism and confirmation certificate. 38.2.8.3 Persons Who Are Married A married person must have the consent of his or her spouse before being baptized. 38.2.8.4 Persons Who Are Cohabiting A couple living together but not married must commit to living the law of chastity before either of them can be baptized. This includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 . It also includes no longer living together or, in the case of a man and a woman, getting married. 38.2.8.5 Persons Whose Church Membership Was Withdrawn or Who Resigned Membership Persons whose Church membership was withdrawn or who resigned membership may be readmitted by baptism and confirmation. They are not considered converts. Missionaries do not interview them for baptism. For instructions, see 32.16 . 38.2.8.6 Situations That Require Authorization from the Mission President or First Presidency Authorization from the mission president is required before a person can be baptized if he or she has ever: <ul> <li> <p>Committed a serious crime (see <a>38.2.8.7</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Participated in an abortion (see <a>38.6.1</a>).</p> </li> </ul> In these cases, the mission president interviews the person. If necessary, the mission president may authorize one of his counselors to conduct the interview. He gives this authorization separately for each interview. The counselor who conducts it reports to the mission president, who may then authorize or deny the baptism and confirmation. Approval from the First Presidency is required before a person can be baptized and confirmed if he or she: <ul> <li> <p>Has committed murder (see <a>38.2.8.7</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Has been convicted of a crime involving sexual misconduct (see <a>38.2.8.7</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Is currently on legal probation or parole for any serious crime or offense (usually punishable by one year in prison or longer) or any crime that involves sexual misconduct (see <a>38.2.8.7</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Has been involved in plural marriage (see <a>38.2.8.8</a>).</p> </li> </ul> For guidance about baptizing and confirming individuals who identify as transgender, see 38.2.8.9 . If the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president interviews him or her. If he finds the person to be worthy and if he recommends baptism, he submits a request for approval to the First Presidency using LCR . If the person is a former member seeking readmission, the bishop and stake president both interview him or her. They follow the instructions in 32.16 . If they both find the person to be worthy and recommend baptism, the stake president submits a request to the First Presidency using LCR . Any request to the First Presidency should include all pertinent details as determined in the interviews. See 6.2.3 about the stake (or mission) president’s responsibility when submitting applications to the First Presidency. 38.2.8.7 Persons Who Have Been Convicted of Crimes Persons who have been convicted of crimes may not be baptized until they complete their terms of imprisonment. This is true for converts and for those seeking readmission. Persons who have been convicted of felonies or any crimes involving sexual misconduct may not be baptized and confirmed until they have also completed their terms of probation or parole. Only the First Presidency may grant an exception (see 38.2.8.6 ). These persons are encouraged to work closely with local priesthood leaders. They strive to do all they can to receive the Savior’s help to become worthy of baptism and confirmation. Full-time missionaries do not teach people who are in prison or jail. A person who has been convicted of murder or a crime involving sexual misconduct may not be baptized unless the First Presidency gives approval (see 38.2.8.6 ). The same is true for a person who has confessed to committing murder even if the confession was in private to a priesthood leader. As used here, murder does not include abortion or police or military action in the line of duty. If the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president follows the instructions in 38.2.8.6 . If the person is a former member seeking readmission, the bishop and stake president follow the instructions in the same section (see also 32.16 ). 38.2.8.8 Adults Involved in Plural Marriage An adult who has encouraged, taught, or been involved in plural marriage must receive approval from the First Presidency before he or she may be baptized. If the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president follows the instructions in 38.2.8.6 . If the person is a former member seeking readmission, the bishop and stake president follow the instructions in 38.2.8.6 (see also 32.16 ). The request should describe the person’s past involvement in plural marriage. It should also describe his or her repentance and current family situation. 38.2.8.9 Individuals Who Identify as Transgender Baptism and confirmation are received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. Worthy individuals who do not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from their biological sex at birth may be baptized and confirmed. (For a definition of social transition, see 38.6.23 .) Any exception to this policy requires the approval of the First Presidency. To request approval, the mission president, or the stake president for an eight-year-old, interviews the person. If he finds the person to be worthy and if he recommends baptism and confirmation, he submits a request for approval to the First Presidency using LCR. If the First Presidency approves baptism and confirmation, the person will not be able to receive the priesthood, a temple recommend, or some Church callings while transitioned. However, the individual may participate in the Church in other ways. Individuals who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may be baptized and confirmed. Mission presidents, or stake presidents for an eight-year-old, address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. They seek counsel from the Area Presidency.

      "38.2.9 Priesthood Ordination For general information about priesthood ordinations, see 18.10 . 38.2.9.1 New Members When a brother is baptized and confirmed, he is eligible to be ordained to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood if he will be at least 12 years old by the end of the year. The bishop interviews him soon after his confirmation, normally within a week. A member of the bishopric presents him in sacrament meeting so ward members can sustain his proposed ordination (see 18.10.3 ). He may then be ordained to the appropriate office: <ul> <li> <p>Deacon, if he will turn 12 or 13 by the end of the year</p> </li> <li> <p>Teacher, if he will turn 14 or 15 by the end of the year</p> </li> <li> <p>Priest, if he will turn 16 or older by the end of the year; if he is 19 or older, he is also considered a prospective elder (see <a>38.2.9.3</a>)</p> </li> </ul> A new member is eligible to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained an elder when he: <ul> <li> <p>Is 18 or older.</p> </li> <li> <p>Has served as a priest (no specified time is required).</p> </li> <li> <p>Has sufficient understanding of the gospel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Has demonstrated worthiness.</p> </li> </ul> Newly baptized brethren are not ordained on the day they are baptized or confirmed. They first need to be interviewed by the bishop and sustained by ward members. Baptisms of family members should not be delayed so the father can receive the priesthood and perform the baptisms himself. 38.2.9.2 Young Men Whose Parents Are Not Married (Including Divorced) A young man may be ordained to Aaronic Priesthood offices when the bishop obtains verbal permission from the parents or guardians. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the ordination. If the young man goes by the surname of his stepfather, he may be ordained in that name. This is true even if he has not been formally adopted. However, the young man’s legal name, as defined by local law or custom, should be recorded on the ordination certificate. 38.2.9.3 Prospective Elders A prospective elder is a male Church member age 19 or older who does not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. Married brethren who are younger than 19 and do not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood are also prospective elders. Under the direction of the bishop, the elders quorum presidency works closely with prospective elders to help them prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. If a prospective elder is not a priest, he should be ordained a priest as soon as he is worthy. He does not need to be ordained a deacon or teacher first. He may be ordained an elder when he has developed sufficient understanding of the gospel and demonstrated his worthiness. The bishop and stake president interview him to make this determination (see 31.2.6 ). For more information about helping prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, see 8.4 . 38.2.9.4 Brethren Who Have Changed Wards within the Past Year Sometimes a brother who has lived in a ward for less than one year needs or desires to be ordained to a Melchizedek Priesthood office. In that situation, the bishop or an assigned counselor contacts the prior bishop to ask if there are any worthiness matters to be considered. If a counselor learns that there is confidential information, he ends the conversation. He informs his bishop to contact the prior bishop before conducting the interview. 38.2.9.5 Brethren in Young Single Adult and Single Adult Wards Worthy men ages 18 and older in young single adult wards and single adult wards should be ordained elders. Those who are not ordained elders are part of the elders quorum as prospective elders. 38.2.9.6 Military Servicemen in War Zones or Isolated Areas A military serviceman is normally interviewed and ordained in the ward that has his membership record. However, this may not be feasible if the serviceman is at sea for an extended time or is serving in a war zone or isolated area. In such cases, the serviceman meets with his service member group leader. If the group leader feels that the serviceman is ready to be ordained, he gives a written recommendation to the presiding leader of the Church unit that oversees the service member group. (If there is not such a Church unit, he gives the recommendation to the Area Presidency.) That leader contacts the bishop of the serviceman’s home ward to certify the man’s worthiness. For ordination to Aaronic Priesthood offices, the presiding leader may authorize the group leader or a Latter-day Saint chaplain to interview the person and oversee the ordination. For ordination to the office of elder, the stake president, mission president, or Area Presidency may authorize a Latter-day Saint chaplain to interview the person and oversee the ordination. All ordinations should be sustained or ratified as explained in 18.10.3 . 38.2.9.7 Brethren Who Have Intellectual Disabilities A male Church member who has an intellectual disability, his parents (where applicable), and the bishop counsel together about whether he should receive the priesthood. They counsel about his desires and whether he has a basic understanding of the priesthood and his responsibilities. Priesthood holders who have such disabilities should be assisted so they can fulfill priesthood duties as fully as possible. 38.2.9.8 Brethren Who Have Been Readmitted by Baptism and Confirmation When a man who was not previously endowed is readmitted to the Church by baptism and confirmation, he may be ordained immediately afterward. He is ordained to the priesthood office he held when his membership was withdrawn or resigned. If the man was previously endowed, he is not ordained to a priesthood office. Instead, his previous office is restored through the ordinance of restoration of blessings. For more information and instructions, see 32.17 . 38.2.9.9 Individuals Who Identify as Transgender Priesthood ordination is received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. A worthy male Church member who does not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from his biological sex at birth may receive and exercise the priesthood. (For a definition of social transition, see 38.6.23 .) Male members who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may receive and exercise the priesthood. Bishops counsel with the stake president to address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. Stake and mission presidents seek counsel from the Area Presidency.

They consider the member’s desires and whether he or she has a basic ability to understand the blessing. If so, a member of the bishopric may issue a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in 18.17 . 38.2.10.2 Missionaries A patriarchal blessing can be a source of spiritual strength for a missionary. If possible, a member should receive a patriarchal blessing before beginning missionary service. When this is not possible, he or she may receive a patriarchal blessing during his or her mission. The mission president interviews the missionary and prepares a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in 18.17 . A missionary at a missionary training center (MTC) may receive a patriarchal blessing only when all of the following apply: <ul> <li> <p>The missionary comes from an area where no patriarch is able to give a blessing in the missionary’s native language.</p> </li> <li> <p>The missionary will serve in a mission where no patriarch is able to give a blessing in the missionary’s native language.</p> </li> <li> <p>A patriarch near the MTC can provide a blessing in the missionary’s native language.</p> </li> </ul> 38.2.10.3 Members Entering the Military A patriarchal blessing can be a source of spiritual strength for a member serving in the military. If possible, a worthy member should receive a patriarchal blessing before reporting for active duty. If this is not possible, the member may be able to receive a patriarchal blessing at his or her permanent duty station. A member of the bishopric there interviews the member and prepares a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in 18.17 . For more information, the stake president may contact the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at Q12Patriarchs@ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 38.2.10.4 Members Who Live outside the Patriarch’s Stake A member normally receives a patriarchal blessing from the patriarch in his or her stake. However, a member may receive a blessing from a patriarch in another stake if he or she: <ul> <li> <p>Is a direct descendant of the patriarch (child, grandchild, or great-grandchild) through birth or adoption.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lives in a stake that does not have a functioning patriarch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lives in a district.</p> </li> <li> <p>Does not speak the same language as the stake patriarch, and a patriarch in a nearby stake speaks the member’s language.</p> </li> </ul> In each of these cases, a member of the bishopric or the branch president interviews the member as described in 18.17 . A member of the patriarch’s stake presidency and of the recipient’s stake or mission presidency must approve the recommend through the Patriarchal Blessing System . 38.2.10.5 Translation of Patriarchal Blessings The inspiration and meaning of a patriarchal blessing is difficult to convey in translation. For this reason, members should receive their blessings in the language they understand best. The Church does not provide written translations of patriarchal blessings. Members are not encouraged to translate patriarchal blessings. However, sometimes a member needs a blessing translated into a language he or she understands. The member may find a trusted and worthy member of the Church who can provide the translation. The member should select a skilled translator who understands the spiritual nature and confidentiality of the blessing. Translated copies of blessings are not filed at Church headquarters. A stake president may request a braille transcription of a patriarchal blessing. He contacts the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at Q12Patriarchs@ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 38.2.10.6 Sign Language Interpretation of Patriarchal Blessings If a member is deaf or hard of hearing, his or her patriarchal blessing can be interpreted in sign language. The member identifies an interpreter. It is best if this person is a trusted and worthy member of the Church who understands the doctrinal significance of patriarchal blessings. However, when a member of the Church cannot be found, another capable person can provide the interpretation. 38.2.10.7 Second Patriarchal Blessings In very rare circumstances, a worthy member may request a second patriarchal blessing. However, this is not encouraged, and the request might not be approved. If the member has an important reason for such a request, he or she discusses it with the bishop. If the bishop feels that a second blessing is necessary, he prepares a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in 18.17 . The stake president then interviews the member and reads the original blessing with him or her. If he feels that a second blessing is necessary, he seeks approval from the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at Q12Patriarchs@ChurchofJesusChrist.org . The stake president informs the recipient and the patriarch of the decision of the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. If the request is approved, the stake president approves the recommend in the Patriarchal Blessing System. The stake president tells the recipient that the second blessing replaces the original blessing. The patriarch may then give a second patriarchal blessing.\n",

If a man and woman were sealed and later divorced, the man must receive a sealing clearance before being sealed to another woman (see 38.4.1.5 ). A sealing clearance is necessary even if (1) the previous sealing has been canceled or (2) the previous wife is deceased. A sealing clearance is needed only if a man is divorced from the woman who was most recently sealed to him. For example, if a man received a sealing clearance to be sealed to a second wife after a divorce, and then his second wife dies, he would not need another sealing clearance to be sealed again. A living man may be sealed to a deceased wife from whom he was divorced in life. He must first receive signed consent from his former wife’s widower (if there is one). If he is married, he also must receive written consent from his current wife if she is living.

A living man may be sealed to a deceased wife if she was not sealed to another husband in life. If she was sealed to another husband while living, all men to whom she was married must be deceased before any other man may be sealed to her (see 38.4.1.8 ).

For such a sealing to occur, the woman must first receive from the First Presidency a cancellation of her previous sealing. If the bishop and stake president both feel that a cancellation is justified, the stake president submits an application to the First Presidency using LCR . See 6.2.3 about the stake president’s responsibility when submitting applications to the First Presidency. Time-only marriages in the temple are no longer performed (see 27.3.3 ). 38.4.1.8 Sealing of Deceased Persons Deceased Women. A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. The following table shows when these sealings may take place. <table><tbody><tr><th> <p>She was not sealed to a husband in life</p> </th><td> <p>She may be sealed to all living or deceased men to whom she was married in life. If the man is living, his wife (if he is married) must give written consent (see <a>38.4.1.3</a>). If the man is deceased, his widow (if any) must give written consent.</p> </td></tr><tr><th> <p>She was sealed to a husband in life</p> </th><td> <p>All her husbands must be deceased before she is sealed to other men to whom she was married. This includes former husbands from whom she may have been divorced. Each of the men’s widows (if any) must give written consent.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table> Deceased Men. A deceased man may be sealed to all women to whom he was legally married during his life if (1) they are deceased or (2) they are living, are not currently married, and are not sealed to another man (see 38.4.1.3 ). Before a deceased man may be sealed to a deceased woman to whom he was married in life, the woman’s widower (if there is one) must give written consent. Deceased Couples Who Were Divorced. Deceased couples who were divorced may be sealed by proxy so their children can be sealed to them. See 28.3.5 if either the husband or wife had Church membership withdrawn or had resigned membership. First Presidency approval is required before sealing a deceased couple who obtained a cancellation of their sealing in life. 38.4.1.9 Effects of Divorce If a couple was sealed and later divorced, the blessings of that sealing remain in effect for individuals who are worthy (see 38.4.1.5 and 38.4.1.10 ). A member who remains faithful to temple covenants will receive the personal blessings promised in the temple, even if the person’s spouse has broken the covenants or withdrawn from the marriage. God promises His faithful sons and daughters peace and strength in this life and eternal life in the world to come. See 38.4.2.1 for information about children who are born after a divorce. 38.4.1.10 Effects of Sealing Cancellation While a sealing remains in place, a member who is faithful to temple covenants will receive the personal blessings promised in the temple. This is true even if the person’s spouse has broken the covenants or withdrawn from the marriage. Moreover, God will not require anyone to remain in a sealed relationship throughout eternity against his or her will. Heavenly Father will ensure that each person receives every blessing that his or her desires and choices allow. Once a sealing cancellation has been granted by the First Presidency, the blessings related to that sealing are no longer in force. Any children born to a woman after her sealing to a former husband has been canceled are not born in the covenant unless the mother was sealed to another man before the child’s birth. Priesthood leaders counsel with members seeking a cancellation of a sealing to help them understand these principles. Local leaders honor members’ agency in these decisions. 38.4.1.11 Effects of Resignation or Withdrawal of Church Membership After a couple has been sealed in a temple, if one of them resigns Church membership or has his or her membership withdrawn, his or her temple blessings are also withdrawn. However, the personal blessings of the sealing ordinance for the person’s spouse and children remain in effect if they remain faithful. Any children born to a couple after one or both of them have resigned their membership or had their Church membership withdrawn are not born in the covenant. See 38.4.2.8 .\n",

      "38.4.2 Sealing Children to Parents Parents must be sealed to each other before children are sealed to them (see 38.4.1 ). Members should counsel with their bishop if they have questions about sealing policies that are not answered in this section. The bishop contacts the stake president if he has questions. The stake president contacts the Office of the First Presidency if he has questions. Members who have concerns about the eternal nature of the sealing ordinance and their associated family relationships are encouraged to trust in the Lord and seek His comfort. Heavenly Father will ensure that each person receives every blessing that his or her desires and choices allow. 38.4.2.1 Children Who Are Born in the Covenant Children who are born after their mother has been sealed to a husband in a temple are born in the covenant of that sealing. They do not need to receive the ordinance of sealing to parents. Sometimes a woman who has been sealed to a man later has children with another man. When this occurs, these children are born into the covenant of the woman’s most recent sealing unless they were born (1) after the sealing was canceled or (2) after it was withdrawn due to resignation or withdrawal of Church membership. 38.4.2.2 Children Who Are Not Born in the Covenant Children who are not born in the covenant can become part of an eternal family by being sealed to: <ul> <li> <p>Their natural parents.</p> </li> <li> <p>Their adoptive parents.</p> </li> <li> <p>A natural or adoptive parent and a stepparent (see <a>38.4.2.5</a>).</p> </li> </ul> These children receive the same blessings as if they had been born in the covenant. Sealing living children to living parents. A living child is sealed to only two parents—a husband and wife. If both parents are living, they must be married and sealed to each other. See 27.4.1 for information about issuing temple recommends for children being sealed to their parents. Members who are 21 or older must be endowed to be sealed to their parents (see 26.4.4 ). Sealing living children to deceased parents. A living child is sealed to only one set of parents. The parents must be sealed to each other before children are sealed to them. A member who is an adult at the time his or her parents die is generally sealed to those parents. As used here, the term parents means natural parents, adoptive parents, or a natural parent and a stepparent. The following table shows sealing options available to a person whose parents died when he or she was still a minor or who is not accountable due to intellectual disabilities. <table><thead><tr><th> <p>Circumstance</p> </th><th> <p>Options</p> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <p>Minor child</p> </td><td> <ul> <li> <p>Be sealed to adoptive parents or legal guardians who are raising him or her</p> </li> <li> <p>Wait until he or she is an adult and then choose to be sealed either (1) to the deceased parents or (2) to the adoptive parents or legal guardians who raised him or her</p> </li> </ul> </td></tr><tr><td> <p>Person who is not accountable due to intellectual disabilities</p> </td><td> <ul> <li> <p>Be sealed to adoptive parents or legal guardians who are caring for him or her</p> </li> </ul> </td></tr></tbody></table> See 27.4.1 for information about issuing temple recommends for children being sealed to their parents. Members who are 21 or older must be endowed to be sealed to their parents (see 26.4.4 ). Sealing deceased children to parents (living or deceased). A deceased person is usually sealed to his or her birth or adoptive parents. However, a deceased child may also be sealed to: <ul> <li> <p>A birth mother and stepfather.</p> </li> <li> <p>A birth father and stepmother.</p> </li> <li> <p>Foster parents or grandparents who raised the child (see <a>38.4.2.4</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>A couple who intended to adopt the child but could not complete the adoption before the child died (see <a>38.4.2.4</a>).</p> </li> </ul> These sealings may be done even if a deceased child is already sealed to his or her birth or adoptive parents. Sealings to nonbiological or nonadoptive parents in circumstances other than those listed above require First Presidency approval. 38.4.2.3 Adopted or Foster Children Who Are Living Living children who are born in the covenant or have been sealed to parents cannot be sealed to any other parents without First Presidency approval. Living children who are legally adopted and were neither born in the covenant nor sealed to former parents may be sealed to their adoptive parents after the adoption is final. A copy of the final adoption decree should be presented at the temple. A court decree granting legal custody is not sufficient clearance for a sealing. There is no obligation to identify the natural parents of these children. First Presidency approval is needed for a living member to be sealed to foster parents. This requirement applies even if the natural parents of the foster child are unknown. Such requests are made by the stake president using LCR (see 6.2.3 ). 38.4.2.4 Adopted or Foster Children Who Are Deceased A deceased adopted person is usually sealed to his or her adoptive parents. A deceased foster child is usually sealed to his or her natural parents. 38.4.2.5 Sealing of Living Children to One Natural Parent and a Stepparent Minor children and children who are not accountable. Living minor children and children who are not accountable due to intellectual disabilities may be sealed to one natural parent and a stepparent only if all the following conditions are met: <ul> <li> <p>The child was not born in the covenant or sealed previously.</p> </li> <li> <p>The child has not been adopted by another parent.</p> </li> <li> <p>The other natural parent has given a signed letter of consent for the sealing to take place. A court decree granting legal custody is not sufficient clearance for a sealing. The letter of consent should use wording similar to the following:</p> <p>“I, [name of natural parent], give permission for [name of child or children] to be sealed in the temple to [name of parents]. I understand that the sealing is a religious ceremony and does not have legal implications.”</p> <p>This letter is presented at the temple before the sealing.</p> </li> </ul> If the other natural parent is deceased or if his or her parental rights have been fully terminated by legal process, no consent is required. Likewise, no consent is required if the child is considered an adult in the jurisdiction where he or she lives. If the other natural parent cannot be located after thorough efforts to find him or her, no consent is required. In this case, the bishop and stake president certify in the verification process that thorough efforts to locate the missing parent have failed. If the other natural parent comes forward at a later date, the sealing will be subject to review. Adult children. A living adult member may be sealed to one natural parent and a stepparent if the member was not born in the covenant or previously sealed to parents. Members who are 21 or older must be endowed before being sealed to a natural parent and a stepparent. Married members who are younger than 21 do not need to be endowed to be sealed to a natural parent and a stepparent. However, they must have a current temple recommend to be sealed to parents (see 26.4.4 ). See 27.4.1 for information about issuing temple recommends for children being sealed to their parents. 38.4.2.6 Children Conceived by Artificial Insemination or In Vitro Fertilization Children conceived by artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization are born in the covenant if their parents are already sealed. If the children are born before their parents are sealed, they may be sealed to their parents after their parents are sealed to each other. 38.4.2.7 Children Born to Surrogate Mothers If a child was born to a surrogate mother, the stake president refers the matter to the Office of the First Presidency (see 38.6.22 ). 38.4.2.8 Status of Children When a Sealing Is Canceled or Withdrawn Faithful children who are born in the covenant or sealed to parents retain the blessings of eternal parentage. This is true even if: <ul> <li> <p>The sealing of their parents is later canceled.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Church membership of either parent is later resigned or withdrawn.</p> </li> </ul> Children who are born after their parents’ sealing is canceled or withdrawn are not born in the covenant. These children may be sealed to their parents after their parents’ temple blessings are restored (if applicable) and any other obstacles are removed.\n",

When you put on your garment, you put on a sacred symbol of Jesus Christ. Wearing it is an outward expression of your inner commitment to follow Him. The garment is also a reminder of your temple covenants. You should wear the garment day and night throughout your life. When it must be removed for activities that cannot reasonably be done while wearing the garment, seek to restore it as soon as possible. As you keep your covenants, including the sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances, you will have greater access to the Savior’s mercy, protection, strength, and power.” The garment should be worn beneath the outer clothing. It is a matter of personal preference whether other undergarments are worn over or under the temple garment. Members should not modify or alter the garment to accommodate different styles of clothing. Members should not inappropriately display the garment to those who do not understand its significance. See 26.3.3 .\n",

However, they should avoid inappropriately displaying the garment to the view of those who do not understand its significance. Members should seek the guidance of the Spirit and use tact, discretion, and wisdom. In some cases, it may be best to lay the garment aside temporarily and wear it again when conditions allow. However, mere inconvenience in wearing the garment does not justify laying it aside. Sometimes service regulations prevent a member from wearing the garment. In these cases, the member’s religious status is not affected. The Lord focuses on the heart and a willing mind (see Doctrine and Covenants 64:34 ). As long as the member remains worthy, he or she will still receive the blessings associated with wearing the garment. If members are unable to wear the garment, they should wear it again as soon as circumstances allow. Members in these organizations should consult with their individual services on specific requirements that undergarments must meet, such as color or neckline style.

An endowed person who stopped wearing the garment before his or her death may be buried or cremated in temple clothing if the family requests. A person whose blessings have not been restored after withdrawal or resignation of Church membership may not be buried or cremated in temple clothing. A person who was endowed in life and who died by suicide may be buried or cremated in temple clothing. Temple clothing that is used for burial or cremation need not be new, but it should be in good condition and clean. The member’s own temple clothing may be used. A member who is to be buried or cremated in temple clothing may be dressed by an endowed family member of the same gender or by the spouse. If a family member is not available or would prefer not to dress the body of an endowed man, the bishop may ask the elders quorum president to invite an endowed man to dress the body or to oversee the proper dressing. If a family member is not available or would prefer not to dress the body of an endowed woman, the bishop may ask the Relief Society president to invite an endowed woman to dress the body or to oversee the proper dressing. Leaders ensure that this assignment is given to a person who will not find it objectionable. A man’s body is dressed in temple garments and the following white clothing: a long-sleeve shirt, necktie or bow tie, pants, socks, and shoes or slippers. A woman’s body is dressed in temple garments and the following white clothing: a long-sleeve or three-quarter-sleeve dress (or a skirt and long-sleeve or three-quarter-sleeve blouse), socks or hosiery, and shoes or slippers. Ceremonial temple clothing is placed on the body as instructed in the endowment. The robe is placed on the right shoulder and tied with the drawstring at the left waistline. The apron is secured around the waist. The sash is placed around the waist and tied in a bow over the left hip. A man’s cap is usually placed beside his body until it is time to close the casket or container. The cap is then placed with the bow over the left ear. A woman’s veil may be draped on the pillow at the back of her head. The veiling of a woman’s face before burial or cremation is optional, as determined by the family. In some areas only a licensed funeral director or an employee of the director is allowed to handle a deceased body. In these cases, an endowed family member or an endowed person who is invited by the bishop or Relief Society president ensures that the clothing is properly placed on the body. Some countries require that deceased persons be dressed in biodegradable clothing when they are buried. Biodegradable temple clothing is available at store.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . In areas where temple clothing may be difficult to obtain in time for burial, stake presidents should keep on hand at least two complete sets of medium-sized clothing, one for a man and one for a woman.

      "38.6.1 Abortion The Lord commanded, “Thou shalt not … kill, nor do anything like unto it” ( Doctrine and Covenants 59:6 ). The Church opposes elective abortion for personal or social convenience. Members must not submit to, perform, arrange for, pay for, consent to, or encourage an abortion. The only possible exceptions are when: <ul> <li> <p>Pregnancy resulted from forcible rape or incest.</p> </li> <li> <p>A competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy.</p> </li> <li> <p>A competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.</p> </li> </ul> Even these exceptions do not automatically justify abortion. Abortion is a most serious matter. It should be considered only after the persons responsible have received confirmation through prayer. Members may counsel with their bishops as part of this process. Presiding officers carefully review the circumstances if a Church member has been involved in an abortion. A membership council may be necessary if a member submits to, performs, arranges for, pays for, consents to, or encourages an abortion (see 32.6.2.5 ). However, a membership council should not be considered if a member was involved in an abortion before baptism. Nor should membership councils or restrictions be considered for members who were involved in an abortion for any of the three reasons outlined earlier in this section. Bishops refer questions on specific cases to the stake president. The stake president may direct questions to the Office of the First Presidency if necessary. As far as has been revealed, a person may repent and be forgiven for the sin of abortion.\n",

      "38.6.2 Abuse Abuse is the mistreatment or neglect of others in a way that causes physical, sexual, emotional, or financial harm. The Church’s position is that abuse cannot be tolerated in any form. Those who abuse their spouses, children, other family members, or anyone else violate the laws of God and man. All members, especially parents and leaders, are encouraged to be alert and diligent and do all they can to protect children and others against abuse. If members become aware of instances of abuse, they report it to civil authorities and counsel with the bishop. Church leaders should take reports of abuse seriously and never disregard them. All adults who work with children or youth are to complete children and youth protection training within one month of being sustained (see ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). They are to repeat the training every three years. When abuse occurs, the first and immediate responsibility of Church leaders is to help those who have been abused and to protect vulnerable persons from future abuse. Leaders should not encourage a person to remain in a home or situation that is abusive or unsafe. 38.6.2.1 Abuse Help Line In some countries, the Church has established a confidential abuse help line to assist stake presidents and bishops. These leaders should promptly call the help line about every situation in which a person may have been abused—or is at risk of being abused. They should also call it if they become aware of a member viewing, purchasing, or distributing child pornography. The help line is available for bishops and stake presidents to call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Contact information is provided below. <ul> <li> <p>United States and Canada: 1-801-240-1911 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-1911</p> </li> <li> <p>United Kingdom: 0800 970 6757</p> </li> <li> <p>Ireland: 1800 937 546</p> </li> <li> <p>Countries in the Europe Central Area: +49 69 54802 016 or <a><span>EURC-Abuse@ChurchofJesusChrist.org</span></a></p> </li> <li> <p>Australia: 02 9841 5454 (from within the country)</p> </li> <li> <p>New Zealand: 09 488 5592 (from within the country)</p> </li> </ul> Bishops and stake presidents should call the help line when addressing situations involving any type of abuse. Legal and clinical professionals will answer their questions. These professionals will also give instructions about how to: <ul> <li> <p>Assist victims and help protect them from further abuse.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help protect potential victims.</p> </li> <li> <p>Comply with legal requirements for reporting abuse.</p> </li> </ul> The Church is committed to complying with the law in reporting abuse (see 38.6.2.7 ). Laws differ by location, and most Church leaders are not legal experts. Calling the help line is essential for bishops and stake presidents to fulfill their responsibilities to report abuse. A bishop should also notify his stake president of instances of abuse. In countries that do not have a help line, a bishop who learns of abuse should contact his stake president. The stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office. 38.6.2.2 Counseling in Cases of Abuse Victims of abuse often suffer serious trauma. Stake presidents and bishops respond with heartfelt compassion and empathy. They provide spiritual counseling and support to help victims overcome the destructive effects of abuse. Sometimes victims have feelings of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders help them and their families understand God’s love and the healing that comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see Alma 15:8 ; 3 Nephi 17:9 ). Stake presidents and bishops should help those who have committed abuse to repent and to cease their abusive behavior. If an adult has committed a sexual sin against a child, the behavior may be very difficult to change. The process of repentance may be very prolonged. See 38.6.2.3 . Stake presidents and bishops should also be caring and sensitive when working with the families of victims and perpetrators of abuse. Guidance for counseling victims and offenders is provided at Abuse: How to Help . In addition to receiving the inspired help of Church leaders, victims, offenders, and their families may need professional counseling. For information, see 31.3.6 . For information about what bishops and stake presidents should do when they learn of any type of abuse, see 38.6.2.1 . For information about counseling in cases of sexual abuse, rape, or other forms of sexual assault, see 38.6.18.2 . See also FamilyServices.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 38.6.2.3 Child or Youth Abuse Abuse of a child or youth is an especially serious sin (see Luke 17:2 ). As used here, child or youth abuse includes the following: <ul> <li> <p><i>Physical abuse:</i> Inflicting serious bodily harm by physical violence. Some harm may not be visible.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Sexual abuse or exploitation:</i> Having any sexual activity with a child or youth or intentionally allowing or helping others to have such activity. As used here, sexual abuse does not include consensual sexual activity between two minors who are close in age.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Emotional abuse:</i> Using actions and words to seriously damage a child or youth’s sense of self-respect or self-worth. This usually involves repeated and continuing insults, manipulations, and criticisms that humiliate and belittle. It may also include gross neglect.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Child pornography:</i> See <a>38.6.6</a>.</p> </li> </ul> If a bishop or stake president learns of or suspects child or youth abuse, he promptly follows the instructions in 38.6.2.1 . He also takes action to help protect against further abuse. A Church membership council and record annotation are required if an adult member abuses a child or youth as described in this section. See also 32.6.1.1 and 38.6.2.5 . Physical or emotional bullying between children or youth of a similar age should be addressed by ward leaders. A membership council is not held. 38.6.2.4 Abuse of a Spouse or Another Adult Abuse of a spouse or another adult can occur in many ways. These include physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse. Adults who are elderly, vulnerable, or disabled are sometimes at high risk for abuse. Often there is not a single definition of abuse that can be applied in all situations. Instead, there is a spectrum of severity in abusive behavior. This spectrum ranges from occasionally using sharp words to inflicting serious harm. If a bishop or stake president learns of abuse of a spouse or another adult, he promptly follows the instructions in 38.6.2.1 . He also takes action to help protect against further abuse. Leaders seek the direction of the Spirit to determine whether personal counseling or a membership council is the most appropriate setting to address abuse. They may also counsel with their direct priesthood leader about the setting. However, any abuse of a spouse or another adult that rises to the levels described below requires holding a membership council. <ul> <li> <p><i>Physical abuse:</i> Inflicting serious bodily harm by physical violence. Some harm may not be visible.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Sexual abuse:</i> See the situations specified in <a>38.6.18.3</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Emotional abuse:</i> Using actions and words to seriously damage a person’s sense of self-respect or self-worth. This usually involves repeated and continuing insults, manipulations, and criticisms that humiliate and belittle.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Financial abuse:</i> Taking advantage of someone financially. This may include the illegal or unauthorized use of a person’s property, money, or other valuables. It may also include fraudulently obtaining financial power over someone. It could include using financial power to coerce behavior. See also <a>32.6.1.3</a>.</p> </li> </ul> 38.6.2.5 Church Callings, Temple Recommends, and Membership Record Annotations Members who have abused others should not be given Church callings and may not have a temple recommend until they have repented and Church membership restrictions have been removed. If a person abused a child or youth sexually or seriously abused a child or youth physically or emotionally, his or her membership record will be annotated. He or she must not be given any calling or assignment involving children or youth. This includes not being given a ministering assignment to a family with youth or children in the home. It also includes not having a youth as a ministering companion. These restrictions should remain in place unless the First Presidency authorizes removal of the annotation. See 32.14.5 for information about annotations. 38.6.2.6 Stake and Ward Councils In stake and ward council meetings, stake presidencies and bishoprics regularly review Church policies and guidelines on preventing and responding to abuse. They teach the key messages in the Abuse section of Life Help in the Gospel Library. They invite discussion from council members. Leaders and council members seek the guidance of the Spirit as they teach and discuss this sensitive subject. Council members are also to complete children and youth protection training (see 38.6.2 ). 38.6.2.7 Legal Issues Relating to Abuse If a member’s abusive activities have violated applicable law, the bishop or stake president should urge the member to report these activities to law enforcement personnel or other appropriate government authorities. The bishop or stake president can obtain information about local reporting requirements through the Church’s help line (see 38.6.2.1 ). If members have questions about reporting requirements, he encourages them to secure qualified legal advice. Church leaders and members should fulfill all legal obligations to report abuse to civil authorities. In some locations, leaders and teachers who work with children and youth are considered “mandated reporters” and must report abuse to legal authorities. Similarly, in many locations, any person who learns of abuse is required to report it to legal authorities. Bishops and stake presidents should call the help line for details about mandated reporters and other legal requirements for reporting abuse. The Church’s policy is to obey the law.\n",

It is the privilege of married couples who are able to bear children to provide mortal bodies for the spirit children of God, whom they are then responsible to nurture and rear (see 2.1.3 ). The decision about how many children to have and when to have them is extremely personal and private. It should be left between the couple and the Lord. Church members should not judge one another in this matter. The Church discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control. Surgical sterilization includes procedures such as vasectomies and tubal ligations. However, this decision is a personal matter that is ultimately left to the judgment and prayerful consideration of the husband and wife. Couples should counsel together in unity and seek the confirmation of the Spirit in making this decision. Surgical sterilization is sometimes needed for medical reasons.

It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Only a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife should have sexual relations. In God’s sight, moral cleanliness is very important. Violations of the law of chastity are very serious (see Exodus 20:14 ; Matthew 5:28 ; Alma 39:5 ). Those involved misuse the sacred power God has given to create life. A Church membership council may be necessary if a member: <ul> <li> <p>Has sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman, such as adultery, fornication, same-sex relations, and sexual encounters online or over the phone (see <a>32.6.2</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Is in a form of marriage or partnership that is outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman, such as cohabitation, civil unions and partnerships, and same-sex marriage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Uses pornography intensively or compulsively, causing significant harm to a member’s marriage or family (see <a>38.6.13</a>).</p> </li> </ul> The decision about whether to hold a membership council in these situations depends on many circumstances (see 32.7 ). For example, a council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive. See 32.6.1.2 for when a council is required for sexual sins. In some cases, personal counseling and informal membership restrictions may be sufficient (see 32.8 ).\n",

As used here, incest is sexual relations between: <ul> <li> <p>A parent and a child.</p> </li> <li> <p>A grandparent and a grandchild.</p> </li> <li> <p>Siblings.</p> </li> <li> <p>An uncle or aunt and a niece or nephew.</p> </li> </ul> As used here, child, grandchild, siblings, niece, and nephew include biological, adopted, step, or foster relationships. Incest can occur between two minors, an adult and a minor, or two adults. If a stake president has questions about whether a relationship is incestuous under local laws, he seeks guidance from the Office of the First Presidency. When a minor is a victim of incest, the bishop or stake president calls the Church’s abuse help line in countries where it is available (see 38.6.2.1 ). In other countries, the stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office. A Church membership council and record annotation are required if a member commits incest (see 32.6.1.2 and 32.14.5 ). Incest almost always requires the Church to withdraw a person’s membership. If a minor commits incest, the stake president contacts the Office of the First Presidency for direction. Victims of incest often suffer serious trauma. Leaders respond with heartfelt compassion and empathy. They provide spiritual support and counseling to help them overcome the destructive effects of incest. Sometimes victims have feelings of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders help them and their families understand God’s love and the healing that comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see Alma 15:8 ; 3 Nephi 17:9 ). In addition to receiving the inspired help of Church leaders, victims and their families may need professional counseling. For information, see 38.6.18.2.\n",

Such activities include (but are not limited to) fortune-telling, curses, and healing practices that are imitations of the priesthood power of God (see Moroni 7:11–17 ).

The Church provides the following resources to help people whose lives are affected by pornography: <ul> <li> <p><a>AddressingPornography.ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a>AddictionRecovery.ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a></p> </li> <li> <p><cite>Helping Those Who Struggle with Pornography</cite> (booklet)</p> </li> <li> <p><a><cite>Let Virtue Garnish Thy Thoughts</cite></a> (booklet)</p> </li> </ul> Stake presidents and bishops also provide support to family members as needed. Some exposure to pornography may be inadvertent. Intentional use of pornography is harmful—whether occasional or intensive. Personal counseling and informal membership restrictions are usually sufficient when helping a person repent of using pornography (see 32.8 ). Membership councils are not usually held. However, a council may be necessary for intensive and compulsive use of pornography that has caused significant harm to a member’s marriage or family (see 38.6.5 ). A council is required if a member makes, shares, possesses, or repeatedly views pornographic images of children (see 38.6.6 ).

Prejudice is not consistent with the revealed word of God. Favor or disfavor with God depends on devotion to Him and His commandments, not on the color of a person’s skin or other attributes. The Church calls on all people to abandon attitudes and actions of prejudice toward any group or individual. Members of the Church should lead out in promoting respect for all of God’s children. Members follow the Savior’s commandment to love others (see Matthew 22:35–39 ). They strive to be persons of goodwill toward all, rejecting prejudice of any kind.

The Church also promotes understanding in society at large that reflects its teachings about kindness, inclusiveness, love for others, and respect for all human beings. The Church does not take a position on the causes of same-sex attraction. God’s commandments forbid all unchaste behavior, either heterosexual or same-sex. Church leaders counsel members who have violated the law of chastity. Leaders help them have a clear understanding of faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, the process of repentance, and the purpose of life on earth. Behavior that is inconsistent with the law of chastity may be cause for holding a Church membership council (see 38.6.5 ). It can be forgiven through sincere repentance. Feeling same-sex attraction is not a sin. Members who have these feelings and do not pursue or act on them are living in accordance with Heavenly Father’s plan for His children and with Church doctrine. Leaders support and encourage them in their resolve to live according to the commandments of the Lord. Members with these feelings may receive Church callings, have temple recommends, and receive temple ordinances if they are worthy. Male Church members may receive and exercise the priesthood. All members who keep their covenants will receive all promised blessings in the eternities whether or not their circumstances allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life (see Mosiah 2:41 ).

As used here, sexual abuse is defined as imposing any unwanted sexual activity on another person. Sexual activity with a person who does not or cannot give legal consent is considered sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can also occur with a spouse or in a dating relationship. For information about sexual abuse of a child or youth, see 38.6.2.3 . Sexual abuse covers a broad range of actions, from harassment to rape and other forms of sexual assault. It can occur physically, verbally, and in other ways. For guidance about counseling members who have experienced sexual abuse, rape, or other forms of sexual assault, see 38.6.18.2 . If members suspect or become aware of sexual abuse, they take action to protect victims and others as soon as possible. This includes reporting to civil authorities and alerting the bishop or stake president. If a child has been abused, members should follow the instructions in 38.6.2 . 38.6.18.1 Abuse Help Line If a bishop or stake president learns of sexual abuse, rape, or another form of sexual assault, he calls the Church’s abuse help line in countries where it is available (see 38.6.2.1 for contact information). Legal and clinical professionals will answer his questions. These professionals will also give instructions about how to: <ul> <li> <p>Assist victims and help protect them from further harm.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help protect potential victims.</p> </li> <li> <p>Comply with legal requirements for reporting.</p> </li> </ul> In countries that do not have a help line, a bishop who learns of these offenses should contact his stake president. The stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office. 38.6.18.2 Counseling for Victims of Sexual Abuse, Rape, and Other Forms of Sexual Assault Victims of sexual abuse, rape, or other forms of sexual assault often suffer serious trauma. When they confide in a bishop or stake president, he responds with heartfelt compassion and empathy. He provides spiritual counseling and support to help victims overcome the destructive effects of abuse. He also calls the Church’s abuse help line for guidance where it is available (see 38.6.18.1 ). Sometimes victims have feelings of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders do not blame the victim. They help victims and their families understand God’s love and the healing that comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see Alma 15:8 ; 3 Nephi 17:9 ). While members may choose to share information about the abuse or assault, leaders should not focus excessively on the details. This can be harmful to victims. In addition to receiving the inspired help of Church leaders, victims and their families may need professional counseling. For information, see 31.3.6 . 38.6.18.3 Membership Councils A membership council may be necessary for a person who has sexually assaulted or abused someone. A membership council is required if a member committed rape or is convicted of another form of sexual assault (see 32.6.1.1 ). A council must also be held for sexual activity with a vulnerable adult. As used here, a vulnerable adult is a person who, because of physical or mental limitations, either cannot consent to the activity or cannot understand the nature of it. To address other forms of sexual abuse, leaders seek the Spirit’s guidance about whether personal counseling or a membership council is the most appropriate setting (see 32.6.2.2 and 32.8 ). In severe cases a council is required. Leaders may counsel with their direct priesthood leader about the setting. If membership restrictions result from a membership council that is held for a perpetrator of sexual abuse, that person’s membership record is annotated.

For information about how to help someone who is suicidal or someone who has been affected by suicide, see suicide.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Most people who have thought about suicide want to find relief from physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual pain. Such individuals need love, help, and support from family, Church leaders, and qualified professionals. The bishop provides ecclesiastical support if a member is considering suicide or has attempted it. He also immediately helps the member obtain professional help. He encourages those close to the person to seek professional help as needed. Despite the best efforts of loved ones, leaders, and professionals, suicide is not always preventable. It leaves behind deep heartbreak, emotional upheaval, and unanswered questions for loved ones and others. Leaders should counsel and console the family. They provide nurturing and support. The family may also need professional support and counseling. It is not right for a person to take his or her own life. However, only God is able to judge the person’s thoughts, actions, and level of accountability (see 1 Samuel 16:7 ; Doctrine and Covenants 137:9 ). The family, in consultation with the bishop, determines the place and nature of a funeral service for the person. The family may choose to use Church facilities. If the person was endowed in life, he or she may be buried or cremated in temple clothing. Those who have lost a loved one to suicide can find hope and healing in Jesus Christ and His Atonement.

      "38.6.23 Individuals Who Identify as Transgender Gender is an essential characteristic in Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness (see Genesis 1:27 ). The intended meaning of gender in “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” is biological sex at birth. (For those whose biological sex is not clear at birth, see 38.7.7 .) Some people feel their inner sense of gender does not align with their biological sex at birth. The Church does not take a position on the causes of these feelings. Some who experience these feelings identify as transgender. These individuals often face complex challenges. They—and their family and friends—should be treated with sensitivity, kindness, compassion, and Christlike love. All are children of God and have divine worth. The ordinances of salvation and exaltation are received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. For guidance about administering these ordinances, refer to the following: <ul> <li> <p>Baptism and confirmation (see <a>38.2.8.9</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Priesthood ordination (see <a>38.2.9.9</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Temple ordinances (see <a>26.5.7</a>)</p> </li> </ul> Worthy individuals who do not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from their biological sex at birth may enjoy all the privileges of Church membership. Church leaders counsel against pursuing surgical, medical, or social transition away from one’s biological sex at birth. (Social transitioning means intentionally identifying and presenting oneself as other than one’s biological sex at birth, and may include changing dress, grooming, names, or pronouns.) Leaders advise that taking these actions will result in some Church membership restrictions. These restrictions include receiving or exercising the priesthood, receiving or using a temple recommend, and serving in some Church callings. Individuals who transition away from their biological sex at birth are welcome to attend sacrament meetings and participate in the Church in many other ways. These individuals and their families are encouraged to counsel with their local leaders regarding Church participation. Church leaders teach gospel truth and minister in a Christlike way. They consider the needs of all involved. Sections of this handbook—such as attendance at Church meetings and activities (see 38.1.1 ), participation in family history work (see 25.1 and 25.4 ), service to others (see 22.2.3 ), and so on—should guide leaders as they counsel with individuals and their families. For further guidance on Church participation of individuals who identify as transgender, refer to these guiding principles . Members who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may enjoy all the privileges of Church membership. Circumstances vary greatly from person to person and can change over time. Members who feel their inner sense of gender does not align with their biological sex at birth or who identify as transgender, as well as the parents or guardians of minors facing such circumstances, are encouraged to seek counsel from their bishop. Bishops counsel with the stake president to address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. Stake and mission presidents seek counsel from the Area Presidency. National and local laws vary regarding individuals who identify as transgender. In the United States and Canada, stake presidents and mission presidents who have questions about legal requirements should contact the Church’s Office of General Counsel: 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301 1-801-240-6301 Outside the United States and Canada, these leaders should contact the area legal counsel at the area office.

The Church policies outlined in this section are consistent with international treaties that apply in most countries. For simplicity, this section refers to a creator’s rights as “copyright.” However, certain of these rights may be known by different names in some countries. Church members should strictly observe all copyright laws. Generally, only copyright owners may authorize the following uses of their work: <ul> <li> <p>Duplication (copying)</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribution</p> </li> <li> <p>Public performance</p> </li> <li> <p>Public display</p> </li> <li> <p>Creation of derivatives</p> </li> </ul> Using a work in any of these ways without authorization from the copyright owner is contrary to Church policy. Such use may also subject the Church or the user to legal liability. A user of a work should assume that it is protected by copyright. Published works usually include a copyright notice, such as “© 1959 by John Doe.” (For sound recordings, the symbol is ℗.) However, a copyright notice is not required for legal protection. Similarly, the fact that a publication is out of print or posted on the internet does not mean it is not copyrighted. Nor does it justify duplicating, distributing, performing, displaying, or making derivatives of it without permission. The Church’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) assists in processing requests to use copyrighted Church materials or programs, including materials that are copyrighted by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. (IRI). IRI is a separate, nonprofit corporation that owns the intellectual property used by the Church. For information on requesting the use of Church-owned materials, see “ Terms of Use ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . The following questions and answers may help members understand and abide by copyright laws when using copyrighted materials at church and at home. If members have questions that are not answered in these guidelines, they may contact the IPO: Intellectual Property Office 50 East North Temple Street Salt Lake City, UT 84150-0005 Telephone: 1-801-240-3959 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-3959 Fax: 1-801-240-1187 Email: cor-intellectualproperty@ChurchofJesusChrist.org Can I copy published Church materials? Unless otherwise indicated, Church materials may be copied for noncommercial Church, home, and family use. Terms of use that accompany a Church website or app indicate how material on these websites and apps may be used. No commercial use may be made of Church materials without specific written permission from the IPO. Can I copy music? Special copyright laws apply to music. A person may copy music from the following sources for noncommercial Church, home, and family use unless a restriction is noted on the hymn or song: <ul> <li> <p><cite><a>Hymns</a></cite></p> </li> <li> <p>The <cite><a>Children’s Songbook</a></cite></p> </li> <li> <p><a>Church magazines</a></p> </li> </ul> Duplicating printed or recorded music without authorization from the copyright owner is contrary to Church policy. Can I copy materials that are not owned by the Church? Generally not. Copyright laws govern the use of privately owned materials. Usually there are restrictions that give the conditions the public must follow before copying non-Church materials. These restrictions are usually listed near the beginning of a publication. Members should strictly observe all copyright laws. Can I show commercial audiovisual products at Church functions? Generally not. Church members should not violate warnings and restrictions that are placed on commercial audiovisual products. This includes movies, other video, and music. Using commercial audiovisual products at Church functions generally requires permission from the copyright owners. Can I download or duplicate computer software and other programs for Church use? Generally not. Computer programs and other software may not be duplicated or downloaded unless all licenses have been appropriately purchased. What permission is needed to present musical and theatrical productions? Productions that are owned by the Church or IRI may be performed in Church settings without permission from Church headquarters. If a copyrighted production is not owned by the Church, members must obtain the copyright owner’s permission to perform all or part of it in a Church setting. Usually the copyright owner requires fees or royalties even if no charge is made for the performances. All presentations should have the approval of local priesthood leaders.\n",

Members of the Church are encouraged to show respect for the body in their choices about appropriate dress and appearance. What is appropriate varies across cultures and for different occasions. For example, for sacrament meeting, individuals wear their best available Sunday clothing to show respect for Jesus Christ and the sacrament ordinance (see 18.9.3 ). This same principle applies to temple attendance (see 27.1.5 ). Disciples of Jesus Christ will know how best to dress and groom themselves. Members and leaders should not judge others based on dress and appearance. They should love all people, as the Savior commanded (see Matthew 22:39 ; John 13:34–35 ). All should be welcomed at Church meetings and activities (see 38.1.1 ). When issuing temple recommends and ward and stake callings, leaders consider worthiness and the guidance of the Spirit (see 26.3 , 30.1.1 , and 31.1.1 ).\n",

However, Church leaders have counseled against extreme or excessive preparation for possible catastrophic events. Such efforts are sometimes called survivalism. Efforts to prepare should be motivated by faith, not fear. Church leaders have counseled members not to go into debt to establish food storage. Instead, members should establish a home storage supply and a financial reserve over time. See 22.1.4 and “ Food Storage ” (Topics and Questions, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\n",

This same policy applies to speaking with or writing to lawyers or court personnel, including through email. Leaders should speak with Church legal counsel if, in their Church capacities, they: <ul> <li> <p>Believe they should testify or communicate in a legal matter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are being required by legal process to testify or communicate in a legal matter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are ordered to provide evidence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are asked to provide documents or information voluntarily.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are asked to communicate with lawyers or civil authorities about legal proceedings, including sentencing or parole hearings.</p> </li> </ul> However well intentioned, Church leaders sharing information in legal proceedings can be misinterpreted and damaging.

      "38.8.27 Members with Disabilities Leaders and members are encouraged to address the needs of all who live within their unit. Members with disabilities are valued and can contribute in meaningful ways. Disabilities may be intellectual, social, emotional, or physical. Church members are encouraged to follow the Savior’s example of offering hope, understanding, and love to those who have disabilities. Leaders should get to know those who have disabilities and show genuine interest and concern. Leaders also identify members who may need additional care because a parent, spouse, child, or sibling has a disability. Caring for a family member who has a disability can be both rewarding and challenging. Leaders seek out and minister to members with disabilities who are living in group homes or other facilities away from family members. 38.8.27.1 Increasing Awareness and Understanding Leaders, teachers, and other members seek to understand each individual who has a disability and his or her strengths and needs. They can increase their understanding by talking with the person and his or her family members. Resources are available at disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 38.8.27.2 Giving Assistance Leaders assess the needs of those who have disabilities and their caregivers. These leaders determine how ward or stake resources could be used to help meet the needs as appropriate. Leaders encourage members to help and reach out in love and friendship. The bishopric or stake presidency may call a ward or stake disability specialist to help individuals, families, teachers, and other leaders (see 38.8.27.9 ). Leaders may also identify appropriate community resources that could help individuals who have disabilities and their families. For more information on assisting persons who have disabilities, see disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Leaders may also contact Family Services (where available; see 31.3.6 for contact information). Leaders and members should not attempt to explain why someone has a disability or why a family has a child with a disability. They should not suggest that a disability is a punishment from God (see John 9:2–3 ) or a special privilege. 38.8.27.3 Providing Ordinances See 38.2.4 . 38.8.27.4 Providing Opportunities to Serve and Participate Many members with disabilities can serve in nearly any Church assignment. Leaders prayerfully consider the abilities, circumstances, and desires of each person and then provide appropriate opportunities to serve. Leaders also counsel with the individual and his or her family. They consider the effects of a Church calling on the person and his or her family or caregiver. (See Doctrine and Covenants 46:15 .) When considering Church assignments or callings for caregivers of people with disabilities, leaders carefully evaluate the circumstances of the caregivers. Leaders and teachers should include members with disabilities in meetings, classes, and activities as fully as possible. Lessons, talks, and teaching methods should be adapted to meet each person’s needs. For information about adapting lessons, see disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . The bishopric may invite a ward member to help a person with a disability in a meeting or activity. For a class that includes a member with disabilities, the bishopric may call multiple teachers. The teachers work together to meet the needs of all class members. If a person cannot participate in a meeting, class, or activity, leaders and teachers may consult with the member and his or her family about how to meet the member’s needs. The stake president or bishop may approve organizing special classes or programs for members with disabilities (see 38.8.27.5 ). If a person is not able to attend Church meetings, leaders and teachers may provide lesson materials, recordings, or streaming. Streaming of events, including sacrament meetings and funerals, is intended only for those who cannot attend in person (see 29.7 ). For more information about partaking of the sacrament, see 18.9.3 . Leaders encourage priesthood holders who have disabilities to participate in ordinances when appropriate. Beginning in January of the year they turn 12, priesthood holders and young women who have been baptized and confirmed and who are worthy may be baptized and confirmed for the dead in a temple. For guidelines about members with disabilities receiving their own temple ordinances, see 27.2.1.3 and 27.3.1.2 . 38.8.27.5 Organizing Special Classes, Programs, or Units Members who have disabilities or special needs are encouraged to attend Sunday meetings in their wards unless they live in a care facility or residential treatment program where Church programs are organized (see 37.6 ). Units and groups. Wards or branches may be created for members who have unique needs, such as those who are deaf and use sign language (see 37.1 ). Approval is given only by the First Presidency. A ward may be asked to host a group for those with disabilities, such as those who use sign language. For information about the membership records of those attending such units or groups, see 33.6.11 . Deaf members who do not live within a reasonable distance from a deaf unit may attend one virtually. They should obtain permission from the leaders of that unit. Local ward leaders ensure that deaf members are cared for and have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament regularly. Classes. Members with disabilities attend Sunday classes with the members of their ward. However, when needed to meet the needs of adult or youth members with similar disabilities, a ward or stake may organize special Sunday School classes (see 13.3.2 ). Disability activity programs. When needed to meet the needs of adult members with intellectual disabilities, a ward, group of wards, stake, or group of stakes may organize a disability activity program. This program supplements ministering, Sunday Church services, and activities in the local unit. A disability activity program typically serves individuals ages 18 and older. Every effort should be made to integrate members under 18 into their wards and stakes. In unusual situations, leaders may provide supplemental activities for youth beginning in the year they turn 12. When multiple wards participate in a disability activity program, the stake president assigns an agent bishop to oversee it. When multiple stakes participate, the Area Presidency assigns an agent stake president to oversee it. The agent bishop or agent stake president consults with other participating bishops or stake presidents to determine how these programs will be funded. Disability activity leaders. Adult members may be called as disability activity leaders. These leaders plan and carry out the disability activity program. They consult with ward and stake disability specialists (see 38.8.27.9 ) to invite members with disabilities to participate. They counsel together about how to meet those members’ needs. Disability activity leaders are called and set apart under the direction of the agent bishop or agent stake president. A stake president may also assign a high councilor to serve as a disability activity leader. Leaders serving those of any age with disabilities complete the training at ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . For additional safety requirements for leaders, see Activities for Members with Disabilities . When invited, disability activity leaders may attend stake or ward leadership meetings. Guidelines for disability activity programs. Disability activity programs are organized to help participants develop spiritually, socially, physically, and intellectually (see Luke 2:52 ). Leaders determine the frequency of activities. They consider the number of participants, travel distances, and other circumstances. Some people may not be able to participate because of complex medical, physical, intellectual, or behavioral circumstances. Leaders seek other ways to minister to their needs. Participation and safety standards. At least two responsible adults must be present at all activities. The two adults could be two men, two women, or a married couple. Generally, more adults are needed to supervise activities for members with disabilities than are needed for other activities. Adults who help with activities complete the training at ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . They must receive approval from their bishop before participating. For additional safety requirements, see “ Activities for Members with Disabilities .” If inappropriate behavior occurs, leaders’ immediate responsibility is to protect and help the vulnerable person. For information about responding to suspected abuse, see 38.6.2.1 and abuse.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 38.8.27.6 Interpreters for Members Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Members who are deaf or hard of hearing take initiative in working with leaders to meet communication needs. Members and leaders work together to ensure that interpreters are available. Interpreters should be located where members can see them as well as the person speaking. During an ordinance or interview, the interpreter sits or stands close to the person who performs the ordinance or conducts the interview. For more information on interpreting ordinances and blessings, see 38.2.1 . If enough interpreters are available, they rotate approximately every 30 minutes to avoid fatigue. In preparation for sensitive situations such as personal interviews or Church membership councils, leaders counsel with the deaf member. When the member desires, leaders seek an interpreter who is not a family member to preserve confidentiality. These same principles apply for members who are deaf or hard of hearing and do not use sign language but need an oral interpreter to help them read lips. Leaders may organize ward or stake classes to teach the sign language that is used in their area. A helpful resource is Dictionary of Sign Language Terms for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . 38.8.27.7 Privacy Leaders should respect the privacy of members with disabilities both during and outside of leadership meetings where needs are discussed. Leaders do not share diagnoses or other personal information without permission. 38.8.27.8 Service Animals Bishops and stake presidents may determine whether to allow persons with disabilities to use trained service dogs in meetinghouses. Other types of animals, including emotional support animals (comfort pets), are generally not permitted in meetinghouses or at Church-sponsored events, except as specifically required by law. (In general in the United States, the Church is under no legal obligation to admit service dogs or emotional support animals to houses of worship.) Bishops and stake presidents make local decisions. They take into account the needs of persons with disabilities and the needs of others in the congregation. For additional guidelines on the use of service animals in Church facilities, see 27.1.3 and disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 38.8.27.9 Disability Specialist The bishopric or stake presidency may call a ward or stake disability specialist. The specialist helps members with disabilities and their caregivers participate in Church meetings and activities and feel included. The specialist serves members and leaders in the following ways: <ul> <li> <p>Get to know individuals with disabilities and their families.</p> </li> <li> <p>Respond to disability-related questions and concerns from caregivers, leaders, and others.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help individuals access Church materials, meetings, and activities.

Stake presidents direct prison ministry efforts. These efforts include supporting adults and youth who are in custody or have recently been released from prison or jail. This work also includes caring for families and children with an incarcerated parent or loved one.

In accordance with local laws, members are encouraged to register to vote and to study issues and candidates carefully. Principles compatible with the gospel may be found in various political parties. Latter-day Saints have a special obligation to seek out and uphold leaders who are honest, good, and wise (see Doctrine and Covenants 98:10 ). The Church is neutral regarding political parties, political platforms, and candidates for political office. The Church does not endorse any political party or candidate. Nor does it advise members how to vote. In exceptional cases, when moral issues or the Church’s practices are involved, the Church may take a position on political matters. In such cases, the Church may engage in political discourse to represent its views. Only the First Presidency can authorize: <ul> <li> <p>Expressing the Church’s position on moral issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Committing the Church to support or oppose specific legislation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sharing the Church’s perspective on judicial matters.</p> </li> </ul> Local Church leaders should not organize members to participate in political matters. Nor should leaders attempt to influence how members participate. Church members who seek elected or appointed public office should not imply that they are endorsed by the Church or its leaders. Leaders and members should also avoid statements or conduct that might be interpreted as Church endorsement of any political party, platform, policy, or candidate. Even when taking a position on a political matter, the Church does not ask elected officials to vote a certain way or to take a certain position. Members who are elected officials make their own decisions. These officials might not agree with one another or with a publicly stated Church position. They do not speak for the Church. Political choices and affiliations should not be the subject of any teachings or advocating in Church settings. Leaders ensure that Church meetings and activities focus on the Savior and His gospel. Members should not judge one another in political matters. Faithful Latter-day Saints can belong to a variety of political parties and vote for a variety of candidates. All should feel welcome in Church settings. Church records, directories, and similar materials may not be used for political purposes. Church facilities may not be used for political purposes. However, facilities may be used for voting or voter registration where there is not a reasonable alternative (see 35.5.6.3 ).\n",

Referring to the Church and its members in the ways described below identifies a connection between Jesus Christ and members of His Church. References to the Church should include its full name whenever possible. Following an initial reference to the full name, if a shortened reference is needed, the following terms are accurate and encouraged: <ul> <li> <p>The Church</p> </li> <li> <p>The Church of Jesus Christ</p> </li> <li> <p>The restored Church of Jesus Christ</p> </li> </ul> When referring to Church members, the following terms are accurate and preferred: <ul> <li> <p>Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</p> </li> <li> <p>Latter-day Saints (this is a name given by the Lord to His covenant people in the latter days)</p> </li> <li> <p>Members of the Church of Jesus Christ</p> </li> </ul> Referring to Church members by other titles, such as “Mormons” or “LDS,” is discouraged. Mormon is correctly used in proper names such as the Book of Mormon. It is also correctly used as an adjective in historical expressions such as “Mormon Trail.” The term Mormonism is inaccurate, and its use is discouraged. When describing the combination of doctrine, culture, and lifestyle unique to the Church, the phrase “the restored gospel of Jesus Christ” is accurate and preferred.\n",

The Correlation Research Division (CRD) is the only authorized research agency of the Church. CRD may also contract with third-party agencies to conduct research. When Church-authorized researchers contact members or leaders, they provide a CRD employee’s contact information. This employee can answer questions about the research. CRD seeks to protect the identity and responses of research participants. Persons may decline to participate at any time. They may choose not to answer any or all questions. Parents or guardians must give consent before children under 18 are invited to participate in a study. Local leaders should not approve any research related to the Church. This includes using members as research subjects. CRD abides by all data privacy laws. Local leaders should also abide by these laws and should not provide members’ personal information to unauthorized researchers and research agencies. Some research requires collecting information in Church meetings. This is especially true if the meeting is the focus of the study. In such cases, CRD will work with local leaders to ensure that the presence of researchers does not detract from the meetings. To verify any research request, contact the Correlation Research Division: Telephone: 1-801-240-2727 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-2727 Email: research@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n",

Adequate supervision should always be provided to ensure that workers follow instructions, use tools and equipment properly, and avoid hazardous behavior.

A preferred edition of the Bible is then chosen for many languages spoken by Church members. In some languages, the Church publishes its own edition of the Bible. Church-published editions are based on standard Bible texts. Examples include: <ul> <li> <p>The King James Version in English.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Reina-Valera (2009) in Spanish.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Almeida (2015) in Portuguese.</p> </li> </ul> Church-published editions of the Bible include footnotes, subject indexes, and other study aids. When possible, members should use a preferred or Church-published edition of the Bible in Church classes and meetings. This helps maintain clarity in the discussion and consistent understanding of doctrine. Other editions of the Bible may be useful for personal or academic study. 38.8.40.2 Scripture Translation The Lord directed His prophets and apostles to preserve the scriptures in safety (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:56 ). The Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles closely supervises the translation of Church scriptures. Using approved processes helps ensure doctrinal accuracy and preserve evidence of the text’s origins. Area Presidencies submit official requests for new translations of the scriptures to the Church Correlation Department. 38.8.40.3 Modern-Language Scriptures The Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has not authorized efforts to translate or rewrite scripture text into modern or informal language. This counsel does not apply to Church publications for children. 38.8.40.4 Accessing Scriptures Printed copies of scriptures, including some preferred editions of the Bible, are available from Church Distribution Services. Preferred editions of the Bible may also be available at local booksellers, online, and in Bible mobile applications.

However, many sources of information are unreliable and do not edify. Some sources seek to promote anger, contention, fear, or baseless conspiracy theories (see 3 Nephi 11:30 ; Mosiah 2:32 ). Therefore, it is important that Church members be wise as they seek truth. Members of the Church should seek out and share only credible, reliable, and factual sources of information. They should avoid sources that are speculative or founded on rumor. The guidance of the Holy Ghost, along with careful study, can help members discern between truth and error (see Doctrine and Covenants 11:12 ; 45:57 ).

For information about the membership records of those attending such units or groups, see 33.6.11 .

In preparation for sensitive situations such as personal interviews or Church membership councils, leaders counsel with the deaf member. When the member desires, leaders seek an interpreter who is not a family member to preserve confidentiality. These same principles apply for members who are deaf or hard of hearing and do not use sign language but need an oral interpreter to help them read lips.

If such installations are located in a mission rather than a stake, the mission president fulfills these responsibilities. A member of the stake presidency oversees military relations in the stake. He may call a man or a woman to serve as the military relations specialist. This member does not need to have military experience. He or she ensures that resources are provided to support members of the military in the stake. This includes the military service orientation (see 38.9.3 ). 38.9.1.1 Church Services on Military Installations If Church services are held on a military installation, the president of a stake where the installation is located organizes one of the following for military personnel and their families (see 38.9.4 ): <ul> <li> <p>A ward with a bishopric (when authorized by the First Presidency)</p> </li> <li> <p>A branch with a branch presidency</p> </li> <li> <p>A service member group with a service member group leader and assistants</p> </li> </ul> The stake president calls, sets apart, and oversees the leaders of these units. He gives these leaders’ contact information to the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division. He may designate a ward to support each service member group. The stake president works with the Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division to provide a letter of appointment to each bishop, branch president, or group leader. This letter outlines his responsibilities and authorizes him to preside over the unit and conduct meetings. A copy of the letter should be given to the installation chaplain. The United States military requires that a chaplain provide administrative oversight to any religious service held on a military installation. If there is a Latter-day Saint chaplain on the installation, he normally provides such oversight to a Church unit that meets there. The chaplain does not preside at the worship services unless he is the bishop, branch president, or group leader. However, he is expected to attend and participate. A member of the stake presidency coordinates with the senior chaplain at each military installation in the stake. He ensures that bishops of wards whose boundaries encompass a military installation do the same. These leaders inform the chaplain of the ward’s meeting schedule, meeting location, and contact person. The chaplain can give this information to members at the installation. 38.9.1.2 Latter-day Saint Chaplains in Stakes The stake president annually interviews each Latter-day Saint chaplain who lives in the stake. He determines the chaplain’s well-being and worthiness to serve. The stake president also separately interviews each chaplain’s spouse annually. Chaplains and their spouses should have ward or stake callings. A chaplain who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood may serve in leadership callings, such as on the high council or presiding over a military ward, branch, or service member group. However, this calling cannot conflict with his military duties. Chaplains may assist the stake president in the following ways: <ul> <li> <p>Report in stake council meetings on Church units meeting on military installations. These reports should include information about new and returning members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Serve as the liaison between military leaders and the stake president.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help the stake president identify members in the military to call as service member group leaders.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assist with efforts to strengthen new and returning Church members in the military.</p> </li> <li> <p>Help prepare members in the military to receive sacred ordinances and keep their covenants.</p> </li> </ul>\n",

Some members are assigned to a remote or isolated location or are deployed to a war zone. In these cases, the bishop contacts the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division for guidance about membership records (see 38.9.10 ).

      "38.9.4 Church Units for Service Members Members in the military normally participate in wards located near their military installations. However, in the following circumstances, the stake or mission president may organize a ward, branch, or service member group for military personnel and their families at the installation: <ul> <li> <p>There is no ward within a reasonable distance of the military installation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Military personnel do not understand the language spoken in the local ward.</p> </li> <li> <p>Military personnel are unable to leave the military installation because of training requirements or other restrictions.</p> </li> <li> <p>The members’ military unit is or will be deployed to a location where one of the following applies:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Church is not organized.</p> </li> <li> <p>The local Church unit cannot accommodate the members because of a different language.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attendance at local meetings is not feasible.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Members belong to Reserve or National Guard units and participate in weekend drills or annual training exercises.</p> </li> </ul> Wards and branches at military installations are created using the procedures outlined in chapter 37 . Wards and branches are usually established to support both military members and their families. A ward or branch may also be established for military members without their families. Such units may be established for members attending basic or advanced training or on a remote assignment. The military does not normally allow Church members who are not associated with the military to belong to a ward or branch that uses installation facilities. If the number of members or if other circumstances do not justify creating a ward or branch at a military installation, the stake or mission president may establish a service member group. A service member group is a small Church unit that holds Church meetings and looks after members. The group leader does not have priesthood keys. Because of this, he is not authorized to receive tithes and offerings, counsel members about serious sins, restrict membership privileges, or perform other duties that require keys (see 37.7 ). For information about service member groups, see the “Find a Church Location or Leader” and “Information for Group Leaders” sections in the Church’s Military Members page . When a Church unit is established at a military installation, the unit leader coordinates with the senior installation chaplain to arrange for meeting times and use of base facilities. If there is not an installation chaplain assigned to the base, the stake president consults with the commanding officer.\n",

      "38.9.5 Group Leaders in Remote Areas or War Zones Stake or mission presidents normally call and set apart service member group leaders. However, this may not be possible in some remote locations or war zones. Since a group leader is not given priesthood keys with his calling, it is permissible for him to be appointed without being set apart. The priesthood leader who is responsible for the location can appoint a worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holder to serve as the group leader. He first verifies the man’s worthiness with his bishop and stake president. If a Latter-day Saint chaplain is in the area, the priesthood leader can authorize him to call and set apart a group leader. Service member group leaders in isolated locations may obtain Church supplies and materials by contacting the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division (see 38.9.10 ). Sometimes a deployed service member is isolated from other Church members. If the service member holds the Melchizedek Priesthood or is a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, his bishop may authorize him to administer and partake of the sacrament. If there is more than one member at a deployed location, a group leader should be called. The Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division should be notified when a group leader is called. A letter of appointment will be sent to him (see 38.9.1.1 ).\n",

      "{'chapter': 'Supporting Individuals and Families in God’s Work of Salvation and Exaltation', 'section': '\\n2.1', 'text': ['\\n', '\\nThe Role of the Family in God’s Plan\\n\\nThe family is ordained of God and is central to His plan. Each of us “is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents [with] a divine nature and destiny (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org). We are part of their family. We lived with them before we were born on earth.\\nAs part of His plan, Heavenly Father has established families on earth. He intends for families to bring us happiness. Families provide opportunities to learn, grow, serve, repent, and forgive. They can help us prepare for eternal life.\\nIn this life, many people have limited opportunities for loving family relationships. No family is free from challenges, pain, and sorrow. Individuals and families exercise faith in the Lord and strive to live according to the truths He has revealed concerning the family. The Savior has promised that He will help bear the burdens of all who come unto Him (see Matthew 11:28–30).\\nHeavenly Father’s plan of happiness ensures that all His children will have the opportunity to accept His gospel and receive His greatest blessings (see Doctrine and Covenants 137:7–10). All who make and keep covenants with God can experience joy and “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (Doctrine and Covenants 59:23; see also Mosiah 2:41).\\nGod’s promise of eternal life includes eternal marriage, children, and all other blessings of an eternal family. This promise applies to those who are not currently married or are without family in the Church (see 38.1.4). These blessings are assured to all who strive to live as disciples of Jesus Christ.\\n\\n', '\\nEternal Families\\n\\nEternal families are formed when Church members make covenants as they receive the sealing ordinances in the temple. The blessings of an eternal family are realized as members keep those covenants and repent when they fall short. Church leaders help members prepare to receive these ordinances and honor their covenants.\\nEach person may fulfill a number of roles in an eternal family. All family roles are sacred and important. These roles may include mother and father, daughter and son, sister and brother, aunt and uncle, and grandmother and grandfather. Fulfilling these roles in love helps God’s children progress toward eternal life.\\nAn additional aspect of establishing eternal families is performing ordinances in the temple that allow members to be sealed to their deceased ancestors.\\nWith an understanding of God’s plan, members seek the blessings of an eternal family.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nHusband and Wife\\n\\nMarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 49:15). A husband and wife are intended to progress together toward eternal life (see 1\\xa0Corinthians 11:11).\\nOne of the requirements for obtaining eternal life is for a man and a woman to enter the covenant of celestial marriage (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4). A couple makes this covenant when they receive the marriage sealing ordinance in the temple. This covenant is the foundation of an eternal family. When faithfully kept, it allows their marriage to endure forever. Ultimately, they can become like God (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20).\\nGod has commanded husbands and wives to cleave to each other (see Genesis 2:24; Doctrine and Covenants 42:22). In this context, the word cleave means to be completely devoted and faithful to someone. Married couples cleave together by loving and serving each other.\\nCleaving also includes total fidelity between husband and wife. Physical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Tenderness and respect—not selfishness—should guide their intimate relationship.\\nGod has commanded that sexual intimacy is to be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman. Remaining sexually pure before marriage and faithful within marriage helps individuals be truly happy and avoid spiritual, emotional, and physical harm. Parents and Church leaders are encouraged to do all they can to reinforce this teaching. (See 38.6.5.)\\nA couple seeks to be unified in establishing their family (see Genesis 2:24). Being united in marriage requires a full partnership, sharing responsibilities. A husband and wife are equal in God’s eyes. One should not dominate the other. Their decisions should be made in unity and love, with full participation of both.\\nAdam and Eve set an example for husbands and wives. They worked, prayed, and worshipped together (see Moses 5:1,\\xa04). They taught their children the gospel and mourned together over their trials (see Moses 5:12,\\xa027). They were united with each other and with God.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nParents and Children\\n\\nGod’s first commandment to Adam and Eve as husband and wife was to have children (see Genesis 1:28). Latter-day prophets have taught that “God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”; see also Doctrine and Covenants 49:16–17).\\nIt is a sacred privilege and responsibility for a husband and wife to care for the children they are able to bear or adopt. Adoptive parents have the same blessings and responsibilities as biological parents.\\nA loving husband and wife together provide the best setting for rearing and nurturing children. Individual circumstances may prevent parents from rearing their children together. However, the Lord will bless them as they seek His help and strive to keep their covenants with Him.\\nParents have the vital responsibility to help their children prepare to receive the blessings of eternal life. They teach their children to love and serve God and others (see Matthew 22:36–40). They teach them to pray to Heavenly Father and study the word of God (see Alma 37:36–37, 44–46). They help their children understand the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25). They also help them prepare to make covenants as they receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation.\\n“Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). When there is not a husband or father in the home, the mother presides over the family.\\nPresiding in the family is the responsibility to help lead family members back to dwell in God’s presence. This is done by serving and teaching with gentleness, meekness, and pure love, following the example of Jesus Christ (see Matthew 20:26–28). Presiding in the family includes leading family members in regular prayer, gospel study, and other aspects of worship. Parents work in unity to fulfill these responsibilities.\\n“Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). To nurture means to nourish, teach, and support, following the example of the Savior (see 3\\xa0Nephi 10:4). In unity with her husband, a mother helps her family learn gospel truths and develop faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Together they foster an environment of love in the family.\\n“In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). They prayerfully counsel together and with the Lord.\\n\\n  Imagedad teaching family\\n']}\n",

Church members gather on the Sabbath to partake of the sacrament in remembrance of Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see Doctrine and Covenants 59:12).

It deepens conversion to Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\\nA study of the scriptures as outlined in Come, Follow Me is the suggested course of gospel study at home.\\nIndividuals and families seek inspiration as they choose to study what will best meet their needs. In addition to the scripture passages suggested in Come, Follow Me, they might prayerfully consider studying:\\n\\n\\nThe Book of Mormon and other scriptures.\\n\\n\\nGeneral conference messages.\\n\\n\\nChurch magazines and other edifying content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\nHome Evening and Other Activities\\n\\nLatter-day prophets have counseled Church members to hold a weekly home evening. This is a sacred time for individuals and families to learn the gospel, strengthen testimonies, build unity, and enjoy one another.\\nHome evening is flexible according to members’ circumstances. It may be held on the Sabbath or other days and times. It may include:\\n\\n\\nGospel study and instruction (the Come, Follow Me materials may be used as desired).\\n\\n\\nServing others.\\n\\n\\nSinging or playing hymns and Primary songs (see chapter\\xa019).\\n\\n\\nSupporting family members in Children and Youth development.\\n\\n\\nA family council to set goals, resolve problems, and coordinate schedules.\\n\\n\\nRecreational activities.\\n\\n\\nSingle members and others can gather in groups outside the normal Sabbath worship services to participate in home evening and strengthen one another through gospel study. Come, Follow Me may be a resource for those who desire to study together.\\nTo provide time for families to be together, leaders should keep Monday evenings free from Church meetings and activities.\\nLeaders encourage members to be consistent in holding home evening and spending time together as families (see Doctrine and Covenants 64:33). This could include sharing meals, working and serving together, and recreational activities.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nSupporting Individuals\\n\\nChurch leaders assist members who need additional support.
