In these situations, a member of the stake or mission presidency may meet virtually with the member to conduct a temple recommend interview (see 31.4).

A member of the bishopric or the branch president then prints the recommend and gives it to the member.This policy also applies to members in the military who are in isolated areas.

This privilege is reserved for those who are spiritually prepared and striving to live the Lord’s standards, as determined by authorized priesthood leaders.To make this determination, priesthood leaders interview the member using the questions below. Leaders should not add or remove any requirements. However, they may adapt the questions to the age and circumstances of the member.Sometimes members have questions during a temple recommend interview. The priesthood leader may explain basic gospel principles. He may also help members understand the temple recommend questions if needed. However, he should not present his personal beliefs, preferences, or interpretations as Church doctrine or policy.Temple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private.
